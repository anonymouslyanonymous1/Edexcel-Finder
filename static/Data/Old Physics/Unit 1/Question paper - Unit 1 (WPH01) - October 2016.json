(a) state the meaning of the term young modulus.(1) (b)suggest how the fit of a lens and its function are affected when it is made from a material with a high young modulus.(2)fit function","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Physics/2013/Exam%20materials/WPH01_01_que_20161018.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Physics/2013/Exam%20materials/WPH01_01_msc_20170222.pdf"},{"Page":24,"Content":"25*p50707a02528*do not write in this areado not write in this areado not write in this area(c) to investigate the properties of a contact lens, a lens manufacturer placed a rectangular sample of a silicone hydrogel material in a tensile testing machine and a tensile force was exerted on the sample. the resulting stress-strain graph for the sample is shown.0.02.04.06.08.010.012.014.016.0strain / %stress / mpa0.07 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.00 0.08 (i) show that the young modulus of the silicone hydrogel is about 0.6 mpa.(2)turn over    ","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Physics/2013/Exam%20materials/WPH01_01_que_20161018.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Physics/2013/Exam%20materials/WPH01_01_msc_20170222.pdf"},{"Page":25,"Content":"26*p50707a02628*do not write in this areado not write in this areado not write in this area(ii) when a force of 0.101 n is applied across the sample, a strain of 8% is produced. determine the thickness of the sample. width of sample = 5.5  103 m (4)thickness of the sample =  *(iii) the thickness of a lens is not uniform.  an actual lens is placed in the tensile testing machine.  explain why the extension produced is greater where the thickness of the lens is smaller.(3)(total for question 19 = 12 marks)total for section b = 70 marks total for paper = 80 marks","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Physics/2013/Exam%20materials/WPH01_01_que_20161018.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Physics/2013/Exam%20materials/WPH01_01_msc_20170222.pdf"},{"Page":26,"Content":"27*p50707a02728*do not write in this areado not write in this areado not write in this arealist of data, formulae and relationshipsacceleration of free fall g = 9.81 m s2(close to earths surface)electron charge e = 1.60  1019celectron mass                                     me = 9.11  1031kgelectronvolt                                      1 ev = 1.60  1019jgravitational field strength                  g = 9.81 n kg1(close to earths surface)planck constant                                h = 6.63  1034j sspeed of light in a vacuum c = 3.00  108m s1unit 1mechanicskinematic equations of motionv = u + ats = ut + at2v2 = u2 + 2asforcesf = mag = f/mw = mgwork and energyw = fsek = mv2egrav = mghmaterialsstokes lawf = 6rvhookes lawf = kxdensity = m/vpressurep = f/ayoung moduluse = / wherestress  = f/astrain  = x/xelastic strain energyeel = fx","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Physics/2013/Exam%20materials/WPH01_01_que_20161018.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Physics/2013/Exam%20materials/WPH01_01_msc_20170222.pdf"},{"Page":27,"Content":"28*p50707a02828*do not write in this areado not write in this areado not write in this areablank page","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Physics/2013/Exam%20materials/WPH01_01_que_20161018.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Physics/2013/Exam%20materials/WPH01_01_msc_20170222.pdf"}]

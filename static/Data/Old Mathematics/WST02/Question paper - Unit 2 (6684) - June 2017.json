region for a two tailed test of the \npotter’s belief.  you should state the probability in each tail of your critical region.\n(4)\n \nthe potter aims to reduce the proportion of pots which break in the kiln by increasing the \nsize of the batch fired.  he now fires pots in batches of 50.  he then chooses a batch at \nrandom and discovers there are 6 pots which broke whilst being fired in the kiln.\n \n(b) test, at the 5% level of significance, whether or not there is evidence that increasing \nthe number of pots in a batch has reduced the percentage of pots that break whilst \nbeing fired

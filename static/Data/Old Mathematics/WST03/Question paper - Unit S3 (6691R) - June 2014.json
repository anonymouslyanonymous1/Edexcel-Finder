  9.94\n \n \n(i) find a 95% confidence interval for μ to 2 decimal places.\n \n \n(ii) use your result to comment on the accuracy of the petrol gauge.\n(5)\n \n(b) a sample mean of 9.96 litres was obtained from a random sample of n tests.  a 90% \nconfidence interval for μ gave an upper limit of less than 10.00 litres.  find the \nminimum value of

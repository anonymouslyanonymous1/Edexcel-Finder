plants.  these fibres can be used in the manufacture of some materials.  if a fertiliser is applied to the plants during their growth, more fibres can be extracted from their leaves. an investigation was carried out in a laboratory to study the effect of fertiliser on the growth of these plants. a complete fertiliser and a fertiliser without potassium ions were used. the mineral content of the dry

has several shoots.  the flies lay eggs on the shoots and the eggs hatch into larvae. these larvae feed on the shoots and reduce the yield of wheat. the infection of two varieties of wheat, giza and sakha, by the larvae of shoot flies was investigated. ten plants of each variety were selected at random and the number of shoots infected with larvae was recorded. this was repeated to obtain the 12

questions.1 the photograph below shows a field trial of several varieties of durum wheat (triticumdurum) growing in westafrica.this field trial identified three varieties of durum wheat that tolerate temperatures above 37c.  these varieties also gave a good yield of grain after only 100days from planting.observing mitosis can be an indicator of the rate of growth of a plant.  this can be recorded by calculating the mitotic index.the mitotic index (mi) can be calculated using the formulami = number of cells in mitosistotal number of cells 100a sample of tissue from one variety of durum wheat was analysed with the following results.number of cells in mitosis=41number of cells not in

enzymes from the pancreas than healthypeople.one of the enzymes secreted by the pancreas is protease.protease is an enzyme that hydrolyses proteins to form amino acids.the activity of protease can be investigated using a solution of the protein casein as a substrate.  this solution changes from white to colourless as the protein is hydrolysed.a student formed the following hypothesis:the greater the concentration of protease the faster the rate of hydrolysis of casein.plan an investigation to provide evidence to support or reject this hypothesis.your answer should give details under the

student investigated the effect of bile salts on the release of the red pigment contained in beetroot cells. the student prepared cylinders of beetroot and placed them in solutions containing different concentrations of bile salts at 30 c.  the cylinders were left for 20 minutes.  the cylinders were then removed and the colour of each solution was measured.  the colour was measured by shining a light through the solution and recording the amount of light absorbed (absorbance).  this investigation was repeated three times for each concentration of bile salts.  the raw data are shown

the following is an extract from a students report on the topic of genetic testing.gene testingtay-sachs disease is a lethal genetic disorder for which there is no cure.  renee and david abshire, are both healthy carriers of the allele for this disorder.  after they lost one daughter totay-sachs, they decided they would never have another child unless they could be sure that it would be free of the disease.  genetic tests could diagnose the condition before birth, but the abshires beliefs ruled out abortion. then they learned about a technology called pre-implantation genetic testing (pigt), used to screen children for cystic fibrosis.  ova and sperm were collected from the abshires and seven ova were successfully fertilised in vitro.  when these had developed to the eight-cell stage, a cell was taken from each and the dna analysed.  one showed tay-sachs, but three were not even carriers.  these three were implanted into renee and one of these became brittany who was born in january 1994.miracles such as brittany could become common.  an increasing number of fetuses are tested every year as shown by these figures.datenumbers of tests1989   18541990   61141991   9310199263 000genetic tests can also be used to diagnose illnesses in children and adults.  researchers have found genes associated with alzheimers disease, huntingtons disease and breast cancer.  tests based on these and other discoveries could warn people that they are at special risk for those diseases.  used in conjunction with gene therapy that replaces faulty genes with working ones, genetic tests could lead to real cures. but there are concerns over ethical, legal, social and scientific implications.  for example, tests have revealed a large number of people with cystic fibrosis but most of them have only minor respiratory symptoms.  these people would never have thought of themselves as genetically ill.  some male patients are healthy except that they are infertile.51015202530","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_que_20090514.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/8BI01_GCE08_Biology_msc_international_20090717.pdf"},{"Page":8,"Content":"9*n34467a0916*turn over  it has been shown that cystic fibrosis is not caused by a single type of mutation.  although one mutation is associated with 70 percent of all cases, and two others with another 15 to 20 percent, more than 360 mutations have been linked to cystic fibrosis so far.  dna tests designed to find one mutation will miss others.  all these discoveries make it much harder to interpret the results of genetic tests for cystic fibrosis.  a positive test result does not indicate how severely afflicted a patient will be, and a negative test result could be misleadingly reassuring.with this level of uncertainty, it is worrying that in some countries population screening is being attempted.  several screening programmes aimed at detecting genetic diseases in large groups of people have been attempted, some with good results, some with bad.one example of testing gone wrong is the screening programme for sickle cell anaemia during the early 1970s in the usa.  at first, the screening enjoyed popular support.  but soon things turned ugly.  people were rarely educated about the meaning of the tests, so many perfectly healthy carriers of the trait thought they were sick.  this ignorance extended to some state governments as well.  massachusetts passed a law requiring that all children at risk for certain diseases should be screened before enrolment in school. some companies began to deny insurance coverage to carriers on the grounds that they had a pre-existing medical condition.  the u.s. air force academy rejected applicants who were carriers.  some commercial airlines refused to hire carriers as flight attendants because of the mistaken belief that such individuals were particularly likely to faint at high altitudes.  some prominent scientists suggested on television that the best solution to the sickle cell anaemia problem would be for people carrying the gene to stop breeding.  the testing did more harm than good.  so, who should know about the results of genetic screening? an example with greater success is with tay-sachs disease.  the incidence of tay-sachs disease in one group of people is naturally very high (about 1 in every 2 500 births).  however, in the usa at least, this has been reduced to virtually zero in about 30 years to the present day.  however, the frequency of carriers has not changed over this time.3540455055606570","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_que_20090514.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/8BI01_GCE08_Biology_msc_international_20090717.pdf"},{"Page":9,"Content":"10*n34467a01016*

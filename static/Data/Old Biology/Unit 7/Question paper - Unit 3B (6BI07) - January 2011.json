[{"Page":1,"Content":"2*n37700a0216*answer all questions1 farmers spend a lot of money every year adding fertiliser to their crops.   a student wondered whether this is money well spent and which are the most important minerals to add. these questions led him to do a simple mineral deficiency investigation.  he grew radish plants (raphanus sativus) in pots containing a mixture of washed sand and an inert material.  the pots absorbed water and minerals, via a wick system, from a solution containing all the minerals required.  this is shown in the diagram below. the student took radish seeds of about the same mass and put one seed into each of ten pots.  the pots were left for three weeks for the seeds to germinate and the radish seedlings to grow.  the student then counted the number of seedlings and recorded  the mean dry mass of the shoots (stems and leaves) and roots.  the experiment was repeated six times using different solutions, each of which had one mineral missing.  the results of this investigation are shown in the table below.  solution number of plants in final samplemean dry mass / mgshootsrootstotalwith all minerals present 8235139374without potassium10188139327without iron 8231 96327without nitrate10141 75216without calcium 9167 40207without magnesium 9178 29207without phosphate 9186 16202plastic supportwick systemradish seedmixture of washed sand and inert materialsolution containing minerals","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_que_20110112.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_rms_20110309.pdf"},{"Page":2,"Content":"3*n37700a0316*turn over (a) (i) plot the data from the table, in a suitable graphical form, to compare the mean dry masses of shoots and roots in each of the solutions.(4)","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_que_20110112.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_rms_20110309.pdf"},{"Page":3,"Content":"4*n37700a0416*  (ii) calculate the dry mass of all plant material from the seedlings grown in the solution without magnesium.     show your working.(2)answer   mg  (iii) describe and suggest an explanation for the effects of a deficiency of magnesium and nitrate on the growth of radish seedlings in this investigation.(6)","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_que_20110112.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_rms_20110309.pdf"},{"Page":4,"Content":"5*n37700a0516*turn over (b) (i) suggest why it was important to make sure all the seeds were about the same mass at the start of this investigation.(1)  (ii) state the independent variable in this investigation.(1)  (iii) state two variables, other than seed mass, that need to be controlled in this investigation.for each variable, describe how it could be controlled.(4)variable 1  how it could be controlled  variable 2  how it could be controlled  ","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_que_20110112.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_rms_20110309.pdf"},{"Page":5,"Content":"6*n37700a0616*  (iv) the dry mass of shoots and roots was measured in this investigation.    describe how to find the dry mass of shoots and roots.

 along with climate change, the rising acidity of our oceans is yet another reason for us to be concerned about the carbon dioxide we are pumping into the atmosphere.  this means that reducing co2 emissions to the atmosphere appears to be the only practical way to minimise the risk of large-scale and long-term changes to the oceans. however, at present research into the impacts of high concentrations of co2 in the oceans is in its infancy and needs to be developed quickly.  basic chemistry leaves little doubt that burning fossil fuels is changing the acidity of the oceans.  action needs to be taken now or in the very near future to reduce global co2 emissions to the atmosphere in order to avoid the risk of irreversible damage to the oceans.  world leaders should be alerted to this issue as a whole so that they can take action.  perhaps by setting targets for the reduction of co2 emissions because otherwise something like a marine ecosystem will not exist and will cause the world a lot of damage.  we need the oceans to exist even though they are taken for granted. 45505560","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_que_20110112.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_rms_20110309.pdf"},{"Page":9,"Content":"10*n37700a01016* the report lacks data to support what it is saying.   the student thought that the following two graphs (a and b) would be useful. graph a:  graph showing atmospheric carbon dioxide changes over time at mauna lau in hawaii graph b:   graph showing ph changes in the long term data set from the ocean around hawaiiatmospheric carbon dioxide concentration / arbitrary unitslong-term trendmonthly mean7654321019601970198019902000year8.148.128.108.088.068.04ph19851988199119941997200020032006","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_que_20110112.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_rms_20110309.pdf"},{"Page":10,"Content":"11*n37700a01116*turn over (a) (i) suggest where in the report you would put graph a and graph b.  state the line number and give reasons for your choice for each graph.

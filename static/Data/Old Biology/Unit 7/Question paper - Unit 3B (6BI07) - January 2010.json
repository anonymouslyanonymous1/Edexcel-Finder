read the following carefully: in 1775, william withering published a treatise on the foxglove.  in this he reported his research on the use of an extract of foxglove to treat a condition called dropsy. in this condition, the patients blood pressure is raised, leading to tissue fluid collecting in the feet, legs and other areas, causing swelling.  the patient may eventually die as fluid fills the lungs, drowning the patient. after seeing a woman treat herself successfully with a digitalis soup, william withering tried the soup on a few people, with some success.  however, after a patient nearly died, withering gave up his research until he moved to birmingham, where he studied 163 patients with dropsy.  he devised a method to find out the correct dose for his patients and finally described very carefully-recorded findings in his treatise. witherings researches are seen as the earliest example of a scientific drug trial.  a modern drug trial is made up of several stages.  in pre-clinical research, the drug is tested on animals to investigate its general safety before being trialled on humans.  however, unlike humans, animals cannot say whether they are experiencing side effects such as feeling sick, dizziness or mental problems. phase 1 is the first stage of a clinical trial.  in this phase, information is gathered about whether a drug is safe to give to humans.  people can volunteer to be part of a drug trial.  the trial team monitors these people carefully.  they observe their behaviour, ask them how they feel and measure their blood pressure and temperature.  blood and urine samples are taken to look for signs that things might be going wrong.  the level of the drug in the bloodstream or tissues is measured and these data help to determine the safe dose. phase ii testing is used to find the experimental conditions that will allow phase iii of the trial to give a good result.  in particular, the trial team tries to establish the best dose to give.  one thing that must be established immediately is the desired end point.  for instance, the usual end point sought when screening a new antibacterial drug (such as an antibiotic) is whether a patient is free of infection after treatment. in phase ii, a control group is used to distinguish between a natural improvement and the effects of the drug.  ideally, neither the trial team nor the patients know whether they are part of the treatment group or the control group  in other words, they are blind to the type of treatment being given to them.  a placebo may be used.  a placebo is made to look exactly like the drug and the patients are treated with this or the drug, in exactly the same way. phase iii is the final stage in which larger numbers of patients take part.  the team  running the trial will have identified at least one group of patients who are expected to benefit, how they benefit and the best way to administer treatment.  thephase iii trial can provide confirmation that a drug works.  if the results of phase iii testing are not positive, several options remain.  by studying the large amount of data collected, the trial team may identify another smaller group, within the larger group, who seem to have benefited.  another full-scale phase iii trial is carried out on this type of patient. it is common for phase iii trials to be repeated in order to identify a group of patients for whom the drug is effective.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_que_20100115.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI04_01_GCE_pef_20100310.pdf"},{"Page":10,"Content":"11*n35114a01116*turn

the following extract from a students draft and unfinished report on the topic of stem cells.  it is hardly possible to open a newspaper these days without seeing something about stem cells.  it is the self renewing property of stem cells which makes them so special.   in plants, many cells remain totipotent for life and differentiation can be reversed.  stem cells have, therefore been used by botanists for a long time.  the conservation of rare species is one of the uses which has been made of this knowledge.  at kew gardens in london, a project to help in the conservation of some very rare species of mosses was started in 2000.  scientists combined techniques of tissue culture in an environment free of bacteria, fungi etc. (called axenic culture) with low temperature preservation to assist in the conservation of the mosses (bryophytes) in what is called an ex situ project.  this means the project is carried out off site (that is, away from the actual habitat of the species being conserved).  using these methods the scientists have successfully cultured 18 species of very rare mosses at the last count.  the problem still remains, though, that the reason these species are rare is because of a lack of suitable habitat for them to live in.  in humans, adult mature stem cells are multipotent.  embryonic stem cells (es cells) are pluripotent and can develop into many human tissue cells.  es cells are obtained from a human embryo five days after fertilisation.  es cells can only be obtained by destroying the embryo.  it is suggested that if cultured correctly, es cells could have the capability of developing into almost any fully functioning organ or tissue of the body.   stem cells provide hope for patients suffering from conditions including cancer, diabetes, parkinsons disease, alzheimers disease and muscle or tissue damage. entire organs may be able to be developed from embryonic stem cells.  in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy, the stem cells present in the treated area can be completely destroyed.  stem cell replacement is already being tested.  this is known as autologous stem cell rescue.  it has been suggested that it is adult stem cells themselves that are the origins of many, if not all, cancers.  robert weinberg, a cancer geneticist at the whitehead institute in cambridge, mass. stated, i think this is one of the most interesting developments in cancer research in the last five years, and also, i think more and more people are accepting it and evidence is accumulating that cancer stem cells exist in a variety of tumours, (quoted in jiang, dennis the stem cells that promise no miracles, the journal of young investigators, 18 (3), 2008).12345678","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_que_20120307.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_msc_20120215.pdf"},{"Page":8,"Content":"9*p39507a0916*turn over     parkinsons disease affects normal coordination of the patients body due to a loss of nerve cells in the brain that produce a neurotransmitter known as dopamine. it is speculated that if es cells or adult stem cells could be cultured correctly into dopamine producing nerve cells, they could replace the lost nerve cells of the patient.  unlike several other diseases, patients with parkinsons disease could easily benefit from stem cell research.  recently it has been discovered that cell replacement therapy is more effective than full organ transplantation.  this is when healthy stem cells (either from the patient themselves or from an external source) are directly inserted to replace dying or dead stem cells of an organ by intravenous catheter.  by doing this the risks of rejection (when the immune system detects a replaced organ or tissue as foreign and subsequently attempts to destroy it) are lowered significantly and the ethical debate regarding therapeutic cloning is eliminated.  there are many and widespread ethical concerns regarding the destruction of human embryos to gather es cells.  using es cells suggests that a human embryos value does not equal the rights of a living human being.  this argument also suggests that the value of using stem cells in medicine outweighs the rights of embryonic life.  in-vitro fertilisation produces several embryos and some of these are discarded.  should these embryos be used in research rather than being wasted?  there are several counter-arguments. pro-life groups maintain that a human embryos rights are the same as those of a living human being.  they argue that the value of stem cell research is not proven and there may be side effects in stem cell cultures such as tumours.  now it is believed that adult stem cells can be potentially cancerous, adding further weight to critics of such research.  many religious groups do not agree with the use of stem cells in medicine believing that human life begins at fertilisation.  views on stem cell research are widely different in different countries.  one argument suggests that the economic burden that stem cell research places upon nations is too great and the vast sums needed to further enhance such research could be far more usefully spent elsewhere.  the counter argument to this states that with more money, the benefits could be great with regard to disease management and organ donation shortages which could be overcome.910111213","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_que_20120307.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_msc_20120215.pdf"},{"Page":9,"Content":"10*p39507a01016*(a)

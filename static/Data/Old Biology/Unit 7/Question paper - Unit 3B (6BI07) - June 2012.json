read the following extract from a students unfinished draft report on the topic of pain.  pain is natures warning.  when pain is felt, pain receptors activate, sending impulses through the nerve into the spinal cord and to the brain.  an area of the spinal cord called the dorsal horn simultaneously sends a message to the area where pain has been felt so the brain doesnt have to tell you to pull away from the source of pain because the dorsal horn has already done it.  sometimes the pain receptors keep firing, this can be caused by a disease or condition that continuously causes damage, known as chronic pain.  however, there may no longer be a physical cause of pain, but the response is still the same, making chronic pain difficult to pin down and even more difficult to treat.  acupuncture is an ancient method of healing that dates back at least 2,500 years and is widely practised in china.  there have been many studies on the effectiveness of acupuncture compared to medical treatments such as drugs.  one study was by l loh, pw nathan, gd schott, and kj zilkha.  48 patients were used, with the intention of having each patient use each type of treatment for three months then swap.  19 patients were unwilling to change from one to the other.  the results were as follows:method of treatmenttotal number of patientsnumber of patients showinggreat improvementmoderate

over    some studies used placebos to determine whether acupuncture had any effect.  there is a study that looked at the effects of acupuncture versus a placebo in the treatment of headache.  thirty-nine patients received both placebo treatments and acupuncture treatments for 6 weeks.  effectiveness of treatments was evaluated by the use of patient diaries.  in the end, acupuncture was about 20% more effective than the placebo in relieving headaches, but the difference was not significant.  another study done by tavola, gala, conte, & invernizzi in 1992 with a control group researched acupuncture and tension-type headaches.  thirty patients with tension-type headache were randomly chosen to undergo either acupuncture or pretend acupuncture.  although frequency of headaches and pain relief drug consumption decreased significantly with time after the two treatments, the results show that there were no significant differences between acupuncture and placebo treatments.  there have been shown to be a few side effects to do with acupuncture.  a study was conducted by ernst g, strzyz h and hagmeister h in 2003 entitled the incidence of adverse effects during acupuncture therapy  a multicentre survey.  the results showed that, out of 3535 treatments, 402 resulted in minor adverse events including bleeding, bruising, dizziness, fainting, nausea, increased pain and in one case, aphasia (the inability to speak).  the study concluded that, although some side effects had been recorded, if the treatment was conducted according to established safety rules and at appropriate anatomic regions, then it is a safe treatment method.  although this conclusion said the treatment is safe, many other side effects have been recorded, including: nerve injury, infection (from unsterilised needles), small bleedings and nausea.   the benefits to humans would be a reduced amount of pain combined with a reduced amount of pain relief medication, which would be economically beneficial.  there are many risks to medical treatment, most being more harmful and more common than ones associated with acupuncture.  for example, the drug used in the main acupuncture study for pain relief has many and varied side effects:    reduced blood flow nausea    trouble breathing trouble sleeping    persistent sore throat vision problems    easy bruising or bleeding

 an implication of replacing medical treatments with acupuncture would be ethical.  as many of the patients of acupuncture for chronic pain would need repeat treatments over a period of months, possibly years, when new patients start the treatment there will already be many old patients there so it would be difficult to start new patients with the beginning weekly treatments.  so after a while many patients would have to be turned down or referred to less easy to get to places, making the patients that start the treatment later either unable to begin treatment or they would have to take more time out of their day to travel farther to have treatment.  a second implication would be economic as, if acupuncture is accepted as a regular medical treatment under the nhs, doctors would need to be trained how to use it and this would cost money.  also lots more equipment would need to be bought so acupuncture could be done properly.  a third implication would also be economic as repeat treatments of acupuncture would be more costly than medication.  cancer research uk stated that: roughly you should expect to pay between 40 and 80 for your first consultation and between 30 and 70 for following treatments.  making it around 400 for a years worth of treatment minimum.  whereas cheap pain medication can cost around 300 per year maximum making a saving of at least 100.bibliographyin this report i used a paper, called acupuncture versus medical treatment for migraine and muscle tension headaches by loh and others from a peer reviewed journal published in 1984

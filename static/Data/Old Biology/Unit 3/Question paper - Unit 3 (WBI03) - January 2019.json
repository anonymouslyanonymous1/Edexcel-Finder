breast cancer arises when there are mutations within the cells of the breast tissue.  the cells may split into abnormal cells at a fast rate, causing a tumour.  if the tumour has the ability to grow and invade neighbouring cells and spread, then it is cancerous.  cancerous cells can travel through the blood vessels or lymph system (due to the breast and armpit tissue containing lymph nodes) and form in other areas of the breast tissue, and even to other areas in the body.  if the cancer stays within the breast tissue, then it is non-invasive.  most cancers are invasive and travel around the body into normal, healthy tissues.  growing and spreading cancerous cells are life-threatening, and so many forms of treatment are being developed to help treat and prevent cancer.2. most breast cancers rely on oestrogen to grow and spread, these are called oestrogen-receptor positive (er-positive) breast cancers.  they contain protein receptors to which oestrogen attaches.  this stimulates the cell to divide and the cancer to spread and grow.  therefore, hormone therapy is used to treat and prevent the growth and spread of cancer.  the main hormone therapy treatments are tamoxifen and anastrozole.3. tamoxifen is an anti-oestrogen drug used to prevent er-positive breast cancer from growing.  tamoxifen fits into oestrogen receptors and blocks oestrogen from reaching the cancer cells.  this means the cancer either grows more slowly or stops growing altogether.  tamoxifen is a tablet that should be swallowed whole with a glass of water.  the usual dose of tamoxifen is 20mg, and is taken once daily.4. anastrozole, another treatment that works by stopping the conversion of androgens into oestrogen, reduces the amount of oestrogen circulating in the body.  this means that less oestrogen is available to stimulate the growth of er-positive breast cancer cells.  anastrozole is a tablet (1mg) taken once daily and should be taken at the same time each day.5. there have been many studies into the use of and efficiency of tamoxifen and anastrozole.  one study compared how well both of the drugs prevent the progression of cancer.  this study evaluated the efficiency of anastrozole 1mg once daily, relative to tamoxifen 20 mg once daily, in patients with tumours.  in a randomised trial, there were 668 participants, 340 treated with anastrozole and 328 with tamoxifen.  they were followed-up for 19 months.  the time to progression (ttp) was measured.  ttp is the length of time from the start of treatment for the cancer until it starts to get worse, or spread to other parts of the body.  it is a measure of how well a treatment works.  the results of this study showed that the ttp was similar for both treatments (8.2 months for anastrozole and 8.3 months for tamoxifen).  6. anastrozole has a higher cost than tamoxifen.  an economic evaluation of anastrozole versus tamoxifen showed that, at an additional cost of $17597 per year, anastrozole treatment resulted in a mean survival of 12.96 years compared with 12.87 years for tamoxifen.  7. modern medical treatments are often expensive.  in 2008, approximately 72% of cancer deaths occurred in low-income and middle-income countries.  this is due to them not being able to afford treatment to manage or prevent cancer, unlike more economically developed countries.  this is an issue, as everyone should have the right to medical treatment.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_que_20190116.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_msc_20190307.pdf"},{"Page":7,"Content":"8do

dryness, vomiting, headaches, fatigue and skin rash.  there are also some more serious risks with taking tamoxifen.  9. there are many advantages of using anastrozole over tamoxifen when treating breast cancer.  one of them is that anastrozole, unlike tamoxifen, is not associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer.  in addition, incidences of blood clots and vaginal bleeding were reported in fewer patients treated with anastrozole than with tamoxifen (4.8% compared with 7.3% for blood clots and 1.2% compared with 2.4% for vaginal bleeding).  10.however, anastrozole has disadvantages too, some common side effects of anastrozole are hot flushes, joint and muscle pain, vaginal dryness, headaches and fatigue.  11.another way for high-risk women to prevent breast cancer is to have a mastectomy.  this is surgery to remove all breast tissue that could potentially develop breast cancer.  risk-reducing mastectomies are carried out on  non-cancerous, healthy breasts to reduce the risk of breast cancer developing.  by removing as much breast tissue as possible, a mastectomy can reduce the risk of developing breast cancer by up to 90%.  a mastectomy also removes all cancerous tissue from the breast, which is important because if cancerous cells are left behind, there is a risk of the cancer growing back and spreading around the body.  mastectomies can cause bleeding and infections and formation of scar tissue.  women who have a mastectomy have a significant loss of sensation in the breast, which can have an impact on sexuality.  also, they will not be able to breastfeed.  women may also suffer depression and anxiety about their body image.(a) (i) the main solution described in this report is the use of anti-oestrogen drugs.  explain how these drugs

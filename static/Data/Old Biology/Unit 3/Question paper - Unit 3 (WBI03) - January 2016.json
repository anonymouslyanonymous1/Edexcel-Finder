the expense may be reduced, having repercussions  on quality of life.  those who have been forced to wear the more heavyweight and  conspicuous glasses to avoid infection may be relieved.  new jobs may even be  created.  the reduced use of cleaning fluids and daily lenses may reduce waste.    10. however, the proteins may lead to the possibility of worse optical quality.  people  become overly relaxed in the care of their lenses.  side effects remain unknown at  this stage. pmt ","QP_Link":"https://pmt.physicsandmathstutor.com/download/Biology/A-level/Past-Papers/Edexcel-IAL/Unit-3/January 2016 (IAL) QP - Unit 3 Edexcel Biology A-level.pdf","MS_Link":"https://pmt.physicsandmathstutor.com/download/Biology/A-level/Past-Papers/Edexcel-IAL/Unit-3/January 2016 (IAL) MS - Unit 3 Edexcel Biology A-level.pdf"},{"Page":8,"Content":"9 *p46933a0916* turn over       do not write in this area  do not write in this area  do not write in this area   11. there may be a reduced burden on healthcare services from infections due to  contact lenses.  consumers could spend less money on cleaning fluids.  if the life of  each lens is extended, new ones can be bought less often.  however, there may be  higher initial costs from the more complex production process.   12. the introduction of immobilised proteins on the lens results in poorer quality,  defeating the point of the lenses in the first place.  there is a possibility that not all  the surface is treated and therefore any areas without antimicrobial resistance may  increase the risk of infection.    13. in the very delicate environment of the eye it is likely that a foreign body or  change in ph could cause severe damage and inflammation.  as with the drug  trialling process, treated lenses need to go through processes to ensure they are  safe to use.   14. polyethylene glycol (peg) is a repellent substance known to reduce the attractive  forces between surfaces and proteins.  it is non-toxic and optically transparent.  fimbrolides are substances that inhibit the signalling mechanisms between  bacteria in a colony.  in a study, fimbrolide coated lenses reduced the adhesion of  bacteria by between 67 and 92% and for acanthamoeba, 70%.  pmt ","QP_Link":"https://pmt.physicsandmathstutor.com/download/Biology/A-level/Past-Papers/Edexcel-IAL/Unit-3/January 2016 (IAL) QP - Unit 3 Edexcel Biology A-level.pdf","MS_Link":"https://pmt.physicsandmathstutor.com/download/Biology/A-level/Past-Papers/Edexcel-IAL/Unit-3/January 2016 (IAL) MS - Unit 3 Edexcel Biology A-level.pdf"},{"Page":9,"Content":"10 *p46933a01016*   do not write in this area  do not write in this area  do not write in this area   (a) a visit or issue report requires a problem to be identified.     identify the problem described in this extract.

over    2 read the following extract from a students unfinished visit or issue report on the topic of the control of the oriental fruit fly (bactrocera dorsalis).1. fruit flies are one of the most destructive insect pests among almost a million different kinds of known living insect.  their economic importance is widely recognised among scientists and farmers.  the species discussed in this report, bactrocera dorsalis, is the dominant pest species of the tephritid family that causes many crop losses for farmers and south east asian nations.  2. the insect is able to bring about 100% damage to the harvest if not monitored.  b. dorsalis damages fruit by laying eggs beneath the skin of fruits.  only ripe and nearly ripe fruits are attacked.  they lay eggs in the soft spots or cracks in fruit, leaving unsightly holes.  this spoils the fruits appearance and reduces its value, especially in the case of passion fruit (passiflora edulis). 3. the eggs hatch in one to three days after being laid.  the larvae feed for nine to thirty-five days and then pupate in the soil under the host plant.  adult flies emerge after one or two weeks, depending on the climate.  the life cycle continues around the year, which means they pose a year-round threat to host plants.  biologists have been working on solutions for many years.4. the steiner trap was introduced by loren franklin steiner (19041977).  the trap is made from a transparent plastic cylinder with removable covers.  on both ends, there is a small opening that allows the flies to enter.  a tray is placed at the lower part of the trap, to collect specimens for monitoring purposes.  a wire hanger, placed on top of the trap body, is used to hang the trap from the plant.  the trap should be placed at a height of about 2m from ground level. trap entranceremovablecoverstraylurea steiner

the steiner trap attracts flies using male-specific parapheromone lures, namely: tml (trimedlure, t-butyl-4-(or 5)-chloro-2-methyl cyclohexane carboxylate) me (methyl eugenol)  cue-lure (4-(p-acetoxyphonyl)-2-butanone). the lure is a piece of cotton soaked in 2cm3 to 3cm3 of a mixture of the parapheromone and an insecticide, usually malathion.6. the design of the steiner trap has been revised several times when used in different regions of the world, according to its suitability.  the original model of trap is very labour intensive.  the removal of dead flies is time-consuming and not economic.  the trap is made from plastic, which is expensive. 7. field workers and orchard owners around the world have improved the original steiner trap, depending on local needs and conditions.8. the revolutionary modified steiner trap is a popular model widely applied in the orchards of malaysia.  the trap uses methyl eugenol in the lure, but insecticide is excluded.  the name revolutionary was given to it as no insecticide is used, thus helping the environment.  openings of the trap, situated around the middle section of 1.5 dm3 plastic bottles, allow only a one-way passage for the flies.   a layer of oil or water (mixed with a small amount of soap or detergent, to reduce surface tension) is poured into the trap to drown the flies. 9. although there are no data to prove the effectiveness of this modified trap, farmers and orchard owners in the region claim that it is the most effective way to eradicate and control populations of b. dorsalis, because of its low cost and it is easy to set up.10.there are other ways to control fruit flies.  for example, millions of sterile male flies are produced by gene technology.  these male flies are then released into the wild, to allow mating between wild females and sterile males.  the male flies either carry modified genes that stop the fertilisation of eggs, or genes that are inactive.  this solution to the problem is very effective, because it uses the wide dispersal range of these flies.  when the sterile flies mate with wild females, flies are wiped out over a wide area.  this method of eliminating b. dorsalis from newly infested regions has been proven to be effective in the ogasawara islands, japan.11.this species of fruit fly is found to be the pollinator of bulbophyllum orchids, the largest genus in the family orchidaceae.  this genus is the main source of most of the economically important ornamental orchids and consists of a number of threatened species.  it is clear that, if the delicately balanced relationship between these two organisms is disturbed or destroyed, many of the bulbophyllum species will face extinction due to the absence of pollinating insects.

water, to produce an extract.  the extract was pipetted onto discs of filter paper.  other discs of filter paper were soaked in sterile water to use as controls.  all of the discs were then dried.plates were prepared using agar containing the bacterium salmonella typhi.a disc containing the extract and a control disc were placed on each of three agar plates.  the agar plates were incubated for 48 hours.  the diameter of the zone of inhibition was then measured for each disc as shown in the diagram.this method was repeated using three organic solvents, a, b and c, to obtain

over    2 read the following extract from a students unfinished report on the topic of parasitic mites on bees.1. the european honeybee, apis mellifera, is important in agriculture, being the main pollinator of numerous vegetables and fruits.  recently, colony collapse disorder has devastated the honeybee population.  one cause of this disorder is the mite varroa destructor, an ectoparasite of the honeybee.  it attaches itself to the body of a honeybee, and feeds on its blood.  this weakens and shortens the lifespan of the honeybee.  the mites also act as vectors for many pathogens.  it has been estimated that between 3050% of honeybee colonies in britain were destroyed by varroa infestation when the mite first arrived in the uk.2. the life cycle of the mite is synchronised with that of the honeybee: an adult female mite enters a brood cell in the beehive, where the bee larvae develop.  once there, it feeds on the honeybee and lays eggs.  the offspring from these eggs breed in the sealed cell, continuing to feed off the honeybee, until the bee emerges.  when this happens, only the mature female mites leave, the male and immature female mites being unable to live outside the brood cell.3. the varroa mite originates from asia and it is not known how it arrived in the uk in around 1992, but a possible cause is unintentional transportation of honeybees from infected areas, such as in imported goods.4. loss of honeybee colonies through mite infestation can bring economic losses for beekeepers.  those people with a few hives lose a large percentage of their honeybees should a hive be lost.5. at present, there is no method successful enough to completely remove mites from a colony of honeybees.  instead, biologists are working on ways to keep the mite populations under control.  the main method is to use varroacide, which kills the mites.  there are many different types of chemical commonly available for this purpose, each affecting the mites in a different way, but with the same end result  death of the varroa.6. two of the most effective, and hence frequently used, were apistan, and bayvarol, both of which contain synthetically produced pyrethroids as the active chemicals.  pyrethroids are synthetically altered pyrethrins, originally found in the chrysanthemum family.  this group of chemicals functions as an effective varroacide by preventing the sodium channels in neurones from closing.7. another commonly used varroacide is apiguard, which contains thymol, extracted from thyme plants.  thymol is less specific in its effects on the mites, but mainly denatures proteins in the cell membrane.  this disrupts numerous aspects of the cells functioning.8. a third example of a widely used varroacide is oxalic acid.  the treatment relies on the acids corrosive properties.  it damages the proboscis of the mites so they cannot suck the blood of the honeybees.9. all of the above treatments, when used in the correct concentration, kill the mites, but do not damage the honeybees.  bayvarol and apistan kill 95% of mites.  apiguard is slightly less effective, whilst still achieving an average of 93% effectiveness.  oxalic acid can also kill up to 90% of mites in a hive.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/Question-paper-Unit-3-(WBI03)-June-2014.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/Mark-scheme-Unit-3-(WBI03)-June-2014.pdf"},{"Page":9,"Content":"10*p42924a01016*10.a population of over 1000 mites can cause serious damage to the honeybee colony, so numbers should be kept below this level.  the varroacide method of controlling the problem of varroa mites is usually highly effective, whichever method is used.  only a few treatments are required per year.11.varroacide treatments cost about 4 to 5 per hive.  for those who make a business of selling honey, wax and other hive products with many beehives the cost of varroacides can be quite large.12.it must be noted that humans eat the honey produced, so misuse of the varroacides could lead to high levels of the chemicals in the honey.  oxalic acid is one example, as it will dissolve in honey, and is also poisonous to humans.  thymol residues in honey, however, have proven to be relatively safe.  but thymol accumulation in the honey can have the effect of altering the quality of the honey, in particular the taste.13.a major risk of using chemicals to control the population growth of varroa mites is that resistance could develop in a few mites, and the advantageous allele would then be passed on until the whole population is resistant to that form of treatment.  this has already been shown to have happened with bayvarol and apistan.14.for this reason, beekeepers generally rotate treatment by using alternating varroacides, which have different active chemicals.  this reduces the likelihood of resistant mites developing.  this rotation of varroacides can increase the cost.15.some methods rely on purely physical means of removing the mites.  sugar dusting of the mites works because the individual grains of sugar prevent the mites from gripping to honeybees.  these methods are often inexpensive, but require more work than varroacides; they also have lower and more variable efficacies than chemical methods.16.a possible solution for the future is biological control, using one organism to control another.  fungi, native to britain, can kill the mites inside the hive, and will not have an adverse effect on the honeybees.  for these reasons, it appears that this would be a safe method of varroa control.  one advantage of using the fungus is that it is found in britain and so shouldnt have any unknown effects on the environment.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/Question-paper-Unit-3-(WBI03)-June-2014.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/Mark-scheme-Unit-3-(WBI03)-June-2014.pdf"},{"Page":10,"Content":"11*p42924a01116*turn

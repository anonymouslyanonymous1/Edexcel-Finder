over  answer all questions.1 a student was interested in looking at some aspects of the efficiency of biological washing powders.  these powders contain protease enzymes. she found three sources of information about enzymes used in biological washing powders. the first piece of information was about savinase, which is made by a company called novozymes®. the extract below is taken from the novozymes® website: savinase is a cost-efficient protease, effective under most alkaline conditions and is especially effective under medium-temperature wash conditions.  its optimal activity is at 55 °c. further information, from a paper in the archives of dermatological research in 1996, said: in conclusion, the present study suggests that savinase produces blisters on the skin. the third source of information was from a national centre for biotechnology education worksheet on washing-powder enzymes: the enzymes are coated in a low melting-point wax and are therefore safe to handle and unlikely to form airborne dust.  unnecessary contact with the dissolved enzyme should be avoided.  wash splashes with plenty of water.  spills of enzyme solution should be wiped up promptly. using this information, she designed some experiments.  she investigated how much savinase should be used to minimise cost but maximise efficiency in digesting protein-based stains. pieces of photographic film which had a layer of gelatine containing black particles were used.  the gelatine (a protein) was the substrate for the enzyme.  as the gelatine is digested away, the black particles fall off and the film becomes clear.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_que_20100511.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_msc_20100714.pdf"},{"Page":3,"Content":"4*n35856a0416*

zoological parklast week, we visited branston zoological park to see some of the strategies they use when conserving wildlife.  the habitats that the wildlife live in and self-sustaining populations of animals are in danger of extinction.  the day was split up into different sections, and each section was given as an interactive talk with slides, photos and videos.  the first talk we had was an introduction, answering questions about whether there was a need for conservation within the zoo, and also raising points like:• extinction – was there still a problem with animals being close to extinction?• threats – were there animals under serious threat from lots of different factors?• pollution – was pollution having an effect on the above?• hunting – was there as much hunting of animals for only their valuable parts?all these points were raised and discussed.  to most of these questions the answers were yes, however they were not as ‘strongly’ a yes as about 30 years ago.  the number of species that are under threat has gone down because of zoos like branston zoo.  for example, the zoo uses computers to store the same information that at the moment is entered into a stud book, but just electronically.  they also use genetic fingerprinting to keep records of each animal.  these developments are to conserve the wildlife and to make sure that species don’t become under threat or too close to extinction.  another development would be to maintain genetic variation.our next talk was about the role of zoos in conservation breeding.  in this talk, they were discussing their conservation objectives and how their aim was to conserve 90% of genetic variation in the zoo’s populations.  at the moment, they are predicting that they can achieve 90% over the next 100 years.  however, they are aiming to improve this to 90% over the next 200 years.  after this they explained the aims of captive breeding:• conserving genetic variation.• maintaining healthy, self-sustaining populations so the species do not become extinct.trying to restock the wild is costly to the economy, flawed and impractical.  this is because there are so many variables in the wild which are too hard for us to keep constant.  animals should be conserved in the wild, therefore protecting not just single species – like zoos do – but whole ecosystems.  very large amounts of money are used to keep and breed animals in captivity.  this money could be used for conservation in the wild, protecting both the animals and their habitat, thus showing us the importance of conservation.510152025302 read the following extract from a student’s report on the topic of conservation of species by zoos.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_que_20100511.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/6BI07_01_msc_20100714.pdf"},{"Page":8,"Content":"9*n35856a0916*turn over  money could be spent in other areas:• establishing protected reserves: animals should be kept as near as possible to their natural habitat.• funding anti-hunting patrols.• in education: by educating local people to value and protect their wildlife and teaching them the importance of conservation.• lobbying for laws to protect wildlife: to stop wild animals being killed for fur, ivory, horn, or using their body parts for medicines, ornaments and sporting trophies.another interesting thing they mentioned was about keeping records by storing blood samples.  well, this would be a very good idea; especially now that our knowledge of dna is becoming ever better and well known.  maybe the idea of dna fingerprinting would be a good idea because this would mean instead of assigning number codes to different animals they could all have their own unique dna fingerprint.the zoo is thinking about building five more natural enclosures for their tigers.  their reasoning behind all of their future developments is this:• they are committed to the continuing development of their enclosures to provide the highest possible quality of life to their animals.• they believe that the educational experience of their visitors can be enhanced by seeing animals in environments that replicate the animals’ natural habitat.• they aim to promote awareness of the threats that endangered animals face in the wild and assist in the conservation of these species.• they hope that these new enclosures will encourage their visitors to take an active role in conservation.bibliography1. notes

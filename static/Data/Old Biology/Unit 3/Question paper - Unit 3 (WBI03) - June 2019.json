students unfinished issue report on the conservation of tigers.1. the tiger, panthera tigris, is one of the species most threatened with extinction.  inthe last 100 years, the number of wild tigers living in asia decreased from 100000 to 3200.2. of the nine sub-species that existed at the beginning of the 20th century, three have become extinct.  the bali tiger became extinct in the 1930s, the caspiantiger in 1950 and the javan tiger in the 1970s.3. the remainder are listed as endangered, with the siberian (or amur) tiger being one of them.  approximately 350 to 400 adult siberian tigers live in the forests of eastern russia and nearby northeast china and north korea (see figure 1).  their population trend is recorded as being stable, but it is possible they may become extinct, due to many factors.  human-tiger conflict is one of these factors.area containing siberian tigerswww.animalfactguide.comfigure 14. one of the main threats to tigers is poaching.  a study between 1992 and 2002 found that 42% of tigers that died were poached, 33% were suspected of being poached, 8% were killed on roads and 17% died of natural causes.  tigers are killed for their skin to make fur products and for their body parts, such as bones, which are used in traditional medicine.5. the number of humans living near tigers is increasing in many places, which results in the increase of human-tiger conflicts.  human dwellings are getting closer to the territories of the tigers, which cause this increase.6. roads in the habitats of the siberian tiger also increase the number of cases in which human-tiger conflicts occur.  they allow greater access for poachers, and increase deaths from collisions.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_que_20190507.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_rms_20190822.pdf"},{"Page":7,"Content":"8*p56150a0812*do

tigers were studied.  if survival of adult females in areas with no roads is taken as 100%, it was 89% in areas with secondary roads and only 55% in areas with primary roads.  for cubs, the equivalent figures were 91%, 38% and 44%.  this suggests roads should be closed in all tiger habitats.8. the hunting of elk, deer and wild boar reduces prey for siberian tigers.  the tigers may then attack livestock and domestic dogs.  this also causes competition among the siberian tigers, and they sometimes enter villages to feed themselves and their cubs.  the blame is always put on the tigers for straying too close to the human dwellings, even though the root of the problem is too much hunting by humans.9. in february 2010, in a village in russia, a tigress killed two horses and wounded a third over two days.  her behaviour was due to lack of prey.  the tiger was relocated to a place away from humans where she would not be a direct threat.  she was fitted with a gps collar that transmitted her location to a remote receiver every three hours.  she was monitored for a full year without incident and she established a new home range.  this case study shows that moving problem tigers is a viable method to deal with tigers entering settlements.10.saving the siberian tiger helps the local economy.  many people are needed to handle tigers.  various experts, such as scientists and field workers, will be needed to run the conservation programmes.11.siberian tigers help to keep their habitat in favourable conditions.  as top predators, they limit the numbers of herbivores, such as deer.  they also maintain ecological stability by keeping the ecosystem balanced.  without tigers, too many herbivores are present, causing overgrazing and destroying the habitat.  this reduces biodiversity.12.for this reason, the siberian tiger is important for the wellbeing of the people who depend on healthy ecosystems for food, water and many other resources, and for the survival of other wildlife, which itself relies on the balance of the ecosystem.13.using methods such as translocations and monitoring of siberian tigers is an effective alternative to killing problem tigers.  by moving the problem tiger to a new location, human-tiger conflicts decrease and therefore fewer tigers are killed.  humans can feel safer as they will not be in close proximity to any wild tigers.14.apart from the straightforward killing of tigers through human-tiger conflict, another threat to tiger populations is the loss of habitat.  this makes population expansion difficult.  activities such as logging, grazing, development projects and uncontrolled fires all result in direct habitat loss.  tigers need an undamaged habitat in order to survive.  even when it is not totally destroyed, the habitat is often broken up.  the habitat is divided into isolated patches, which prevent mixing of the populations.  this causes the gene pool of the siberian tiger to be extremely small.  in turn, this prevents adaptation to any changes in the environment.  burned areas are also avoided as they do not provide sufficient cover for resting or hunting, nor do they provide the necessary conditions within the habitat for the prey.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_que_20190507.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_rms_20190822.pdf"},{"Page":8,"Content":"9*p56150a0912*turn

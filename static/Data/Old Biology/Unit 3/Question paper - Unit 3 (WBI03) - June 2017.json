do not write in this area do not write in this area do not write in this area2 read the following account from a students draft visit or issue report on mercury poisoning. 1. mercury poisoning is caused by the intake of the heavy metal mercury.  an example of this is minamata disease, which is caused by severe mercury poisoning.  it was first discovered in minamata city in japan in 1956 in a five-year-old girl who had difficulty walking and speaking.  more people began showing similar symptoms and it was reported as an epidemic of an unknown disease of the central nervous system.  2. it was found that the fish these families were eating were contaminated with mercury in the water and therefore passing the mercury poisoning onto the people.  3. many different symptoms of the disease are due to nerve damage.  some people may have numbness in their limbs, difficulty speaking and walking, tremors, uncontrollable shouting and sometimes brain damage.  in extreme cases, paralysis, coma and even death could occur.  of the 1422 patients suffering from minamata disease, 378 had died by the end of 1980.  the first death from minamata disease was in 1972.  babies were born with severe deformities, blindness, mental problems and deafness. 4. mercury was released into the water from the chisso corporations chemical factory.  nothing was done about the polluted water for a long time, the factory continuing to release chemicals until 1968.  this contaminated many generations of fish. 5. chelation therapy is usually used to treat heavy metal poisoning.  a chelating agent works by binding to the heavy metals, making them physiologically inactive.  they are then excreted in urine.  several chelating agents are available for different types of treatment.  one of these is dmsa, a man-made amino acid.  chelation therapy has been the standard treatment used in the uk and the usa. 6. chelating agents can be swallowed or injected into the muscle or put into a vein via a drip.  using a drip is the most common method.  although this can cause infection, it is otherwise safe.  when swallowed, only about 5% of the chelating agent is absorbed into the blood stream so it is not very effective.  some chelating agent pills can be taken at home.  to make them safe, these pills have a very low dosage of the chelating agent.  however, they are not very effective and are not appropriate for treating emergency heavy metal poisoning.  one advantage of a lower dosage is that there are fewer side effects. 7. in 1998, a family of 9 children all suffered from mercury poisoning caused by mercury vapour from a neighbours business.  the children all underwent chelation therapy and the excretion of mercury in their urine was measured every 24 hours after treatment.  the average mercury excreted before treatment was 214.3 g per g of urine.  once treatment was started, the concentration of mercury increased, showing more mercury was being excreted from the kidneys.  on day 5, the average mercury excreted was 668.5 g per g of urine.  the children were given 30 mg per kg per day of dmsa for 5 days.  the children were then discharged and continued to receive home treatment of 20 mg per kg per day.  after 261 days, the level of mercury had reduced in all the children and was now below the accepted limit published by the world health organisation (50 g per g of urine).  no side effects were noted.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_que_20170509.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_rms_20170816.pdf"},{"Page":8,"Content":"9*p48415a0912*turn

performed, the more effective it is.  the longer the mercury is in the blood, the more damage it does to the body and the harder it becomes to reverse the damage.  another benefit of chelation therapy is the cost of the treatment.  it is about a third of the cost of surgery. 9. side effects of chelation therapy include: a burning sensation in the vein at the site of delivery, fever, headaches, nausea, vomiting, convulsions, hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias.  these side effects will not usually cause any permanent damage.  mineral deficiency can also be caused; this can be treated with supplements.  the main concern of chelation therapy is the risk of kidney failure.  if this occurs, it can result in a lifetime of dialysis treatment, or even death. 10. as chelation therapy carries a risk of kidney failure, it could be seen as unethical to treat somebody with it.  some people may not want to take the treatment because of this risk.  if the patient did experience kidney failure, this would have a serious impact on their lives and all the people around them.  11. in 2007, an experiment on rats showed that if there was a low level of metal in the rat, the treatment could lead to lasting brain damage.  in a person, this could affect their learning ability and behaviour.  the use of chelation therapy could have social implications.  12. surgery can sometimes repair damaged nerves caused by mercury poisoning.  one type of surgery is called peripheral nerve reconstruction.  this is reconstruction of the nerve so that it can function again.  another type of surgery is nerve grafting.  this is used to repair large gaps in the peripheral nerves.  it is done by taking segments of the nerves from another part of the body, or using man-made nerves that are inserted.  it can take a long time for the nerve to heal after surgery.  some nerves never repair fully so sensation is weakened.  sometimes the surgery will not be successful and the nerve will not repair at all.  regeneration takes up to 12 months.  if surgery is not performed in the first  6 months of nerve damage, the chances of recovery are reduced. (a) the problem identified in this report is mercury poisoning.   explain why mercury poisoning is a problem.

92% of the mares became  pregnant each year.  there have also been releases of their offspring into reserves  in europe.  this means they have a much more natural diet of grasses.  however,  the climate in europe is far less harsh than in mongolia, creating problems for  their reintroduction into the natural habitat.   6.  they live naturally in herds consisting of a stallion and several mares.  however,  for selective breeding, a stallion and a mare are put in an enclosure together.   the animal is thus deprived of its natural social structure.  to keep their genetic  diversity, horses from different parts of the world are mated.  this involves flying  them across the world.   7.  the cost of transporting each horse is 15 000 us$.  they require vitamins to  supplement hay in order to recreate natural diet and to reduce the risk of catching  laminitis.  veterinary care during foaling and at other times is a huge expense.   they require yearly flu jabs as well as worming every six months.  przewalski s  horses act as an attraction in zoos and may increase visitor numbers and revenue.   this can increase awareness of the plight of the horses and encourage donations  to support the work being done to conserve this species.  this allows zoos to  conserve the species and habitats, locally and globally.   8.  przewalski s horses have been bred in captivity for 90 years but they remain  unreliable and there are risks to humans handling them.  when their hooves  are trimmed, they are anaesthetised, because they are strong animals with a  dangerous kick.  during reintroduction, przewalski s horses bred in captivity could  bring diseases into the wild population. physicsandmathstutor.com ","QP_Link":"https://pmt.physicsandmathstutor.com/download/Biology/A-level/Past-Papers/Edexcel-IAL/Unit-3/June 2016 (IAL) QP - Unit 3 Edexcel Biology.pdf","MS_Link":"https://pmt.physicsandmathstutor.com/download/Biology/A-level/Past-Papers/Edexcel-IAL/Unit-3/June 2016 (IAL) MS - Unit 3 Edexcel Biology.pdf"},{"Page":9,"Content":"10 *p46622a01016*   do not write in this area  do not write in this area  do not write in this area   9.  artificial insemination can be used to breed these horses, rather than relying  on sexual intercourse.  the procedure involves collecting sperm from the male  selected for breeding, freezing it, and transporting the sperm to the female  selected for impregnation.  the sperm is then placed in the uterus so that  fertilisation can take place.  the sperm have a short distance to swim before  reaching the egg so this method has a higher fertilisation success rate.  artificial  insemination also helps to reduce costs as the horses do not have to be  transported.   10. another possibility is to use in-vitro fertilisation (ivf), which has an even higher  success rate than artificial insemination.  eggs are drawn out of the uterus and  are isolated.  sperm from the male is cleaned, deprived of liquid and frozen in  preparation for ivf.  it can then be transported to the location of the female.  the  sperm and eggs are combined in a glass dish, to allow fertilisation to take place.   the fertilised egg is left in the laboratory for several days to begin to divide.  the  embryo is then transferred into the uterus of a female przewalski s horse.  ivf is  more expensive than artificial insemination but less than an ordinary breeding  programme.

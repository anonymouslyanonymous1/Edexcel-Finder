do not write in this area do not write in this area do not write in this area*p51858a0816*2 read the following account from a students draft report on the topic of the prevention of coronary heart disease using aspirin. 1. cardiovascular disease (cvd) refers to any disease that affects the cardiovascular system, principally cardiac disease, vascular diseases of the brain and kidney and peripheral arterial disease.  coronary heart disease is a common type of heart disease and is the leading cause of death worldwide.  it is responsible for around 73 000 deaths in the uk each year.  the disease is caused by plaque building up along the inner walls of the arteries of the heart, which narrows the lumen of the arteries and reduces blood flow to heart tissue. 2. an estimated 83.6million american adults have one or more type of cvd.  ofthese, 42.2million are estimated to be at least 60 years of age.  a diet high in saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease and stroke.  it is estimated to cause about 31% of coronary heart disease and 11% of strokes worldwide.  if it runs in your family, there is also an increased risk. 3. aspirin is a drug used for medical purposes.  it has many uses, especially for preventing blood clots in the arteries and veins, giving it an important role in preventing strokes and cardiovascular disease. 4. when a person gets a cut or scratch, platelets release thromboxane, a chemical that signals other platelets to join and help to form a clot.  however, if you are a stroke survivor, thromboxanes ability to help to form a blood clot becomes life-threatening. 5. research has shown that a low dosage of aspirin can prevent cardiovascular events in people who have already had a heart attack, certain kinds of strokes or other diagnosed cardiovascular disease.  in a group of 10 000 such people, aspirin can prevent 250 cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes.  however, in the same group, 40 cases of serious bleeding occurred.  the ratio of risk to benefit is roughly six people helped for every one harmed. 6. a randomised trial was done for primary-prevention to see the effects of aspirin on heart attack.  22 071 healthy male patients were given 300 mg of aspirin every other day.  there was a 44% reduction in the risk of a first heart attack. 7. a study involving 144 051 patients was carried out.  the research showed that of the 71 912 patients given aspirin, 7705 had serious vascular events.  72 139 patients were given a control treatment and 9502 of these had serious vascular events. 8. although the use of aspirin has its advantages, there are some implications to be considered.  the trials involve the use of animals.  this means that the animals could potentially suffer from stomach bleeds and bowel irritation.  it can be considered unethical to use animals for drug testing because, as complex organisms, they can feel more pain due to a more sophisticated nervous system.  also, they are unable to give consent to these types of procedure. 9. there are also the side effects of aspirin to take into consideration.  aspirin could cause patients to feel indigestion and there is an increased risk of bleeding.  this can be costly for the health services.  aspirin tablets are cheap.  32tablets, each containing 300 mg of aspirin, cost 0.75usd (united states dollar).  however, the cost per transfusion is 400usd.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_que_20180202.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_rms_20180308.pdf"},{"Page":8,"Content":"9turn over     do not write in this area do not write in this area do not write in this area*p51858a0916* 10.  one alternative to aspirin is the use of the drug heparin.  heparin is used as an injectable anticoagulant.  anticoagulants reduce blood clotting.  this means blood clots are less likely to form at sites of damage in artery walls.  anticoagulants can be used to treat patients who already have cardiovascular disease.  they prevent any existing blood clots from growing any larger and prevent any new blood clots from forming. 11. a double blind test was carried out on aspirin and heparin.  heart attacks during the study period occurred in 2(0.8%) of the 240patients in the heparin group and in 9(3.7%) of the 244patients in the aspirin group.  there are many side effects of heparin, which causes aspirin to be better.  side effects of heparin include blood in the urine, constipation, dizziness and many more. 12. another alternative is the use of statins, which are a group of medicines that help lower the level of low-density lipoprotein (ldl) in the blood.  having a high level of ldl is potentially dangerous, as it can lead to atherosclerosis.  statins cost an average of 228.78usd a year per patient.  the nhs bill for statins in 2004 came to 1153millionusd.  meeting this cost could mean diverting money from other treatments or even increasing taxes. 13. statins also have side effects including muscle pain and damage, liver damage and increased blood sugar or type 2 diabetes, along with quite a few less common problems.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_que_20180202.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI03_01_rms_20180308.pdf"},{"Page":9,"Content":"10

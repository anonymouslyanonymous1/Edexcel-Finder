humans have some part to play in this  but most of it is to do with natural factors such as poor habitat size and low  reproductive rates.   2.  giant pandas struggle to find mates in their natural habitat as they live in a  fragmented environment where they are confined to a certain area, this results  in limited movement leaving the pandas isolated.  it is vital for them to find  mates from a wide gene pool to maintain genetic variation throughout the wild  population.  because they are often confined to a small area, pandas mate with  others from their own family tree, which is very bad as they have a poor genetic  make-up.  if this were the case for all pandas, it would take only one disease to  wipe out the entire wild population due to a poor genetic make-up.   3.  giant pandas have very low reproductive rates and a very short breeding season.   another problem the panda faces with breeding is that they take six years    longer than most other animals   to grow into mature adults that can reproduce.   pandas are also very fussy about choosing their mates.   4.  another obstacle for pandas to overcome is bamboo, their main source of food.   shortages across their habitat are common.  bamboo is the most important plant  in a giant panda s life.  in cold and rainy bamboo forests high in the mountains  of western china, they spend at least 12 hours a day eating.  bamboo is low in  nutrients and pandas eat as much as 84 pounds (38 kilograms) of it each day.   however, shortages can occur which can have devastating effects on the panda  population as they could potentially wipe out the whole of their main food source  in that area; this would result in most pandas in that area dying from starvation/ malnutrition.     5.  when bamboo plants reach maturity, they flower and produce seeds, and then  the mature plant dies.  the seeds grow slowly into plants large enough for  pandas to eat.  giant pandas can eat 25 different types of bamboo, but they  usually eat only the 4 or 5 kinds that grow in their home range.  an unusual  thing about bamboo is that all of the plants of one species growing in an area  will bloom and die at the same time.  if the bamboo plants die out, pandas move  to another area full of bamboo.  unfortunately, pandas now struggle to do this  as humans have taken up much of their habitat and divided it in to several small  areas across china.   6.  the giant panda is in decline due to the destruction and separation of its habitat.   destruction of the panda s natural habitat is now the major threat to its survival.   in the 11 years from 1973 to 1984, suitable panda habitat shrunk by 50 per cent  in the six areas where pandas live.  human activity   logging, animal grazing, and  agriculture   is the major source of habitat destruction.   7.  there are methods to help boost populations, the main one being artificial  insemination.  male panda sperm is inserted into the female panda artificially. pmt ","QP_Link":"https://pmt.physicsandmathstutor.com/download/Biology/A-level/Past-Papers/Edexcel-IAL/Unit-3/June 2015 (IAL) QP - Unit 3 Edexcel Biology A-level.pdf","MS_Link":"https://pmt.physicsandmathstutor.com/download/Biology/A-level/Past-Papers/Edexcel-IAL/Unit-3/June 2015 (IAL) MS - Unit 3 Edexcel Biology A-level.pdf"},{"Page":8,"Content":"9 *p44874a0916* turn over       8.  semen is collected from the male by the use of electro ejaculation.  the probe  is inserted via the rectum and placed over the glands of the male s reproductive  tract.  a brief electrical stimulus is applied several times to induce ejaculation.  in  the giant panda a rectal probe has been used in successful semen collections.   the average collection time is around nine minutes.  to reduce stress on the  animal during the procedure, and also to increase the safety of the procedure,  the male is always anaesthetised during the process.  next the panda s semen is  inserted into the female panda so that her egg is fertilised.   9.  the target number of pandas to be bred in captivity was 300 and, as of 2010, this  has been achieved.  the slow process of releasing pandas back in to the wild can  begin.  the release process has to be done slowly so as not to overpopulate the  pandas  habitat.   10. there are some problems with this breeding solution.  the semen used to fertilise  female pandas may come from only a few males.  this creates very low genetic  variation, which can lead to the pandas inbreeding in their natural habitat.  this  puts future generations at risk from mass wipe out due to various diseases as they  all carry some of the same genetic make-up, thus having the same susceptibility  to disease/viruses.   11. due to the use of artificial insemination, pandas may have never bred naturally  with another panda.  so, when released in to the wild they may have no real idea  how to reproduce naturally.  this would be a problem as pandas would be in the  same situation as they are in at the moment; not able to breed and boost their  own population to a sustainable level without human intervention.   12. the use of artificial insemination to breed more pandas can be seen as an  advantage to china s economy.  china leases each panda for 10 years at a price of  $1 million per year.  the government will keep funding the programme as long as  money is coming in.  this is also good publicity for china and its tourism; if people  can t see a giant panda in their home country then they may go to china to see  one.   13. although the main solution to saving the giant panda at the moment is artificial  insemination there are alternatives.  one alternative is the use of cloning, which  is where an organism is produced without sexual reproduction occurring.  taking  an animal cell and inserting its dna into an egg cell from a female make a cloned  animal.  however, there is a problem with cloning mammals at the moment,  they often die soon after birth or suffer from various diseases in later life and die  young. pmt ","QP_Link":"https://pmt.physicsandmathstutor.com/download/Biology/A-level/Past-Papers/Edexcel-IAL/Unit-3/June 2015 (IAL) QP - Unit 3 Edexcel Biology A-level.pdf","MS_Link":"https://pmt.physicsandmathstutor.com/download/Biology/A-level/Past-Papers/Edexcel-IAL/Unit-3/June 2015 (IAL) MS - Unit 3 Edexcel Biology A-level.pdf"},{"Page":9,"Content":"10 *p44874a01016*   (a)  the report lacks data.  the student found the following information in a published  paper about the quality of habitats for pandas.     between 1965 and 1997 the area of high quality habitat decreased from 14 250  hectares to around 11 500 hectares.  the biggest decrease was between 1975 and 1997  when high quality habitat was reduced from 14 000 hectares to 11 500 hectares.  over  the same dates the amount of unsuitable habitat rose from 116 000 hectares to 126 000  and then 134 000 hectares.

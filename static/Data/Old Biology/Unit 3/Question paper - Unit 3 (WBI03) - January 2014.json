 there is a chance that an elephant  may encounter a fence but perceive that there are no bees.  the elephant  becomes aware that it is just speakers, so the chances of trespassing increase.   also, the loudspeaker system would be expensive and require electricity to run it.   11.  there are some problems.  the african honeybee is known to be very violent and  to attack in large swarms.  this could lead to an increase in the amount of deaths  of young elephants, or at least cause them severe suffering.  the introduction of  beehives may also pose a threat to the residents around the local farm.  african  honeybees are well known for their defensive behaviour.  bee stings inject venom  into the skin of the victim, and 3% of people that are stung have an allergic  reaction, meanwhile 0.8% of bee sting victims may experience a life-threatening  reaction called anaphylactic shock. pmt ","QP_Link":"https://pmt.physicsandmathstutor.com/download/Biology/A-level/Past-Papers/Edexcel-IAL/Unit-3/January 2014 (IAL) QP - Unit 3 Edexcel Biology A-level.pdf","MS_Link":"https://pmt.physicsandmathstutor.com/download/Biology/A-level/Past-Papers/Edexcel-IAL/Unit-3/January 2014 (IAL) MS - Unit 3 Edexcel Biology A-level.pdf"},{"Page":9,"Content":"10 *p42914ra01016*   12.  offsetting this though, bee fences can provide extra income to the farmer from  selling the honey.  in addition, it could increase the amount of pollination in  crops.  this would be an ideal plan for poor farmers.  you could call this a win-win  circumstance.  as there is no use of any guns, traps or poison; just a gentle nudge  from nature.   13.  there are some other innovative new methods.  farmers in tanzania smear chilli  mixed with engine oil on fences.  when elephants approach the fence they   snuffle and sneeze  and leave the scene.  it is also an inexpensive and sustainable  process adhering to the fence in all conditions.  however, the advantages of the  beehives overshadow this method.

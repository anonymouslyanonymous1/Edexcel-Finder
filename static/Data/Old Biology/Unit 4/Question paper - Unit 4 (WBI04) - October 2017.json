(a)  suggest one function of the proteins coded for by genes in the mtdna. (1)     (b)  analysis of dna from the nucleus requires the dna to be amplified using the  polymerase chain reaction (pcr).  the dna fragments are then separated by gel  electrophoresis.     (i)  the pcr imitates semi conservative replication of dna in a cell.       compare pcr and semi conservative replication. .

article for use with question 7adapted from: chapter 8: coordination, in, first in fly: drosophila research and biological discovery, stephanie elizabeth mohr, harvard university press, 2018.coordination1. take a clear glass vial of normal adult fruit flies, tap it gently on the table, and the flies will exhibit a stereotyped response: they will remain at the bottom, stunned, for a few milliseconds, then right themselves and quickly begin walking upward along the sides of the vial, toward the stoppered top.  the formal name of this test is the negative geotaxis assay, but in the day-to-day course of research, fly biologists refer to it as the climbing assay.2. just as we slow down and get a little clumsier in old age, so, too, wildtype flies start to perform poorly on the climbing assay as they get older.  for certain mutations, the effects of aging on performance in the assay are more pronounced, such as a failure of older ies to climb even halfway up the vial, poor performance beginning at a younger age, or both.  as with any good scientic assay, the climbing assay can be controlledwith a set of age-matched, wildtype, and untreated ies tested alongside experimental genotypes or drug-treated ies, providing an essential comparison point.  one of the things that is both utilitarian and satisfying about the climbing assay is that it allows a complex behaviour involving coordination of several systemsthe brain, the peripheral nerves, and the musclesto be reduced to a single numerical value.  results of the climbing assay are often presented as the percentage of ies that reached some height within some xed number of seconds after the tap.  3. this assay exemplies one of the most powerful applications of drosophila for biomedical research: the study of neurological function in an intact living system and over the full course of its lifetime.  combined with studies at the leading edge of technologyfrom sophisticated microscopy techniques to multifactorial molecular genetic manipulationsassays like the climbing assay are helping to uncover rst insights into neurological function, and, perhaps even more importantly, dysfunction.the shaking palsy4. many of the genes implicated in parkinsons disease have orthologs* in ies, opening the door to application of the genetic approach.  various engineered strains of drosophila serve as disease models, with specic genotypes of flies exhibiting symptoms or phenotypes that recapitulate features of the disease at the level of cellular, physiological, and whole-animal outcomes.  indeed, the climbing assay is one of the tools that is being used by drosophila researchers to study parkinsons disease.  drosophila models of parkinsons disease offer a number of advantages as compared with other approaches to the study of human diseases, such as the use of human ipscs**.*orthologs  genes in different species that evolved from a common ancestral gene**ipscs  induced pluripotent stem

over    a cellular garbage strike5. ln i998, t. kitada, n. shimizu, and colleagues reported the cloning of a human gene that they called parkin (and was given the official human gene name park2) that is associated with a rare inherited form of parkinsons disease.  there is a stretch of about 70 amino acids at the beginning of the park2 protein that has similarity to short proteins called ubiquitin proteins.  there is also a region with similarity to another type of protein, ring-nger proteins.  a molecular process involving ubiquitin had previously been identied in humans and other organisms, including plants.  the process is a tag-and-grab system, wherein damaged proteins or other biomolecules are recognized; one or more copies of the small ubiquitin protein are ligated or attached to these damaged proteins; and this ubiquitin-tagged cargo is then shuttled into the proteasome, a large multi-protein complex that functions as a garbage disposal, breaking proteins up into smaller, recyclable parts (amino acids).6. the similarity between park2 and ubiquitin suggested that park2 might similarly be involved in the ubiquitin-mediated recycling system.  the fact that specic cellular structures called lewy bodies, which are associated with parkinsons disease but not with normal cells, appear to contain ubiquitin and proteasome components further supported the connection between this system and parkinsons disease.  however, the observation that the park2 sequence diverged in some ways from the protein to which it was being compared, including the presence of an additional region with a different predicted biochemical function, led researchers to speculate that park2 and ubiquitin might have related but not identical roles.7. some researchers turned to drosophila for answers.  in 2000, m. feany and w. bender reported that introduction of the human gene encoding alpha-synuclein (snca) into drosophila resulted in a fly model of parkinsons disease that recapitulates the essential features of the human disorder, including age-related loss of neurons and locomotor dysfunction.  versions of the human gene associated with a dominant inherited form of parkinsons disease resulted in more severe parkinsons disease-related effects than did introduction of the wildtype human gene, for which there is no apparent related gene in the drosophila genome.  other reports followed, including from n. bonini and colleagues, who observed neurotoxicity induced by alpha-synuclein, again consistent with what is observed for parkinsons disease in humans.  unlike the case for snca, there is a gene in drosophila that encodes a protein related to park2, making genetic tests in the fly even more straightforward to perform and interpret.8. insights gained from these studies continued to point researchers in the direction of the cells ability to clean up a mess, which include not only the ability to recycle individual proteins but also the ability to identify organelles that have undergone damage, and recycle them for parts.  mitochondria are the cells power plants, making energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp).  they exist in cells wrapped in a double-layer of membranes, and have the ability to fuse together or split apart, to stretch thin, and to make more of themselves when needed.  one of the insights drosophila research has provided to the parkinsons disease field was to uncover the idea that both the parkin gene product and the drosophila ortholog of another parkinsons-associated gene, pink1, are required for a process called mitophagy, the detection, clean up, and recycling of parts from damaged mitochondria.  research performed in the y also helped to provide insights into the detailed cellular mechanisms of toxicity by alpha-synuclein, pinpointing where the aggregated proteins clog up the cellular system.  similarly, for huntingtons disease, research in the y suggests a role in autophagy, another clean-up crew process that involves many of the same genes and events as mitophagy.  in mitophagy or autophagy, the damaged organelles or other cellular debris are rst enclosed in a membrane.  this newly formed bag of trash then fuses with an organelle called the lysosome in which the proteins, lipids, and other molecules that make up the enclosed material are broken down into component parts that can either be expelled from the cells or reused to form new large biomolecules.acealevelhttp://acealevel.comwww.dynamicpapers.com","QP_Link":"https://dynamicpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IAL_WBI05_01_OCT19.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI05_01_msc_20200123.pdf"},{"Page":31,"Content":"4p58450a9. with a growing understanding of the cellular pathology of parkinsons and other neurodegenerative diseases, researchers are using the y to ask about earlier events.  what are the initiating problems that start cells down a path to neurodegeneration? what are the risk factors?  what might the early diagnostic signs be?  a number of theories exist regarding the specic catalysing disruption of the system that messes things up, including accumulation of metal ions such as zinc and responses to infection, which might subsequently lead to increases in levels of proteins such as alpha-synuclein (in parkinsons disease), amyloid beta (in alzheimers disease), or tau (in tauopathies).  for biologists and physician-scientists, at least, there remain unsatisfying ambiguity and uncertainty.  we dig deeper.  we look for the underlying causes of protein aggregation.  we ask if aggregation is a protective response of the cells, contributes to pathology, or both.ways to model neurological (or other) diseases10. drosophila research has furthered our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases.  can this approach to discovery be applied to other neurological diseases? the answer is yes.  among the things that can differ is the appropriate way in which to model aspects of the disease.  as for parkinsons disease, many y models of disease are based on genetic manipulation.  this can involve introduction of a human gene into ies, as was true for the alpha-synuclein y models of parkinsons disease, as well as for the rst y models of neurodegenerative diseases, models of huntingtons disease and spinocerebellar ataxia 3.  alternatively, the best approach might be to disrupt the endogenous y ortholog (when there is one) or introduce specic changes into the y gene that parallel those found in affected patients.11. below are examples of drosophila models of neurological diseases, or aspects thereof, based on injury, intervention, or observation of relevant normal behaviours.  the section that follows explores how, once established, drosophila models of disease can be used in biomedical studies, including for diagnosis and therapeutic discovery.mechanical model of spinal cord injury12. axons are projections that extend from the main cell body of a nerve cell, allowing nerve impulses to travel relatively long distances at rapid speed, and facilitating the kind of reactions that keep a fly out of danger from a predator or keep our legs churning in a running race.  a particularly long nerve axon extends along the top of the y wing, where it helps control ight.  when this axon is cut, severing the extension from the main body of the nerve cell, the axon degenerates, following a stereotyped sequence of cellular events.  researchers can sever the wing axon from the main cell body in different genotypes of ies and look for mutations that result in preservation, rather than degeneration, following injury to the axon.  identifying such genes might help us understand how to preserve human axons that are disconnected from their cell bodies as a result of axon-damaging diseases or spinal cord injury.intervention model of depression13. one aspect of depression modelled in mammals such as the mouse is the phenomenon of learned helplessness, a failure to escape or avoid a negative stimulus following stress.  a learned helplessness assay typically compares mice in each of three groups: animals not subjected to a stress; animals subjected to a stress but maintaining some level of control or ability to escape the stress; and animals subjected to a stress over which they have no control and no means of escape.  within a normal population, animals in the third group will later exhibit signs of depression such as decreased movement, passive response to a stress, and failure to try to escape a stress under conditions in which animals from the other two treatment groups would do so.  a similar approach has been applied in drosophila.  for fly studies, researchers apply a heat stress to a fly only when

over    it stops walking (control group), or apply the heat stress the same number of times but at random with regard to what the fly is doing when the stress is applied (learned helplessness group).behaviour model of anxiety14. flies will naturally spend more time near the walls of a chamber than in the middle, a behaviour that presumably reduces the risk of predation in the wild.  under normal conditions, wildtype ies will rarely cross the open, middle area of the test arena.  increasing stress, such as through treatment with heat, increases the degree of wall following (the ies cross the middle even less frequently).  by contrast, treating the ies with the anti-anxiety drug diazepam reduces the effect (ies cross the middle more often).  f. mohammad, a. claridge-chang, and colleagues have shown that orthologs of genes known to be involved in anxiety in mammals are relevant to wall following in ies, suggesting that ies can be used for further studies relevant to anxiety and anxiety-related disorders.   putting models to work15. biomarkers can help physicians diagnose a disease and track disease progression.  drosophila can be used in large-scale proteomics, transcriptomics, or metabolomics studies that help determine whether detection of a given molecule correlates with the disease.  efforts to nd early signs of cellular dysfunction in genetic fly models of neurodegenerationassigning a unique prole of neurodegenerative pathology to diseases such as parkinsons and alzheimersare among the fly studies that might end up helping identify human biomarkers that assist physicians in diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases earlier in adulthood or with increased accuracy.  the biomarkers themselves might be genes whose expression changes upon development of the disease; proteins (or their enzymatic activities) detectable at higher or lower levels in patients with the disease; or metabolites that accumulate or are depleted in the disease state but not in unaffected individuals.  16. in addition to implicating new genes, models of disease also allow for deep investigation of cellular and subcellular mechanisms relevant to the disease.  for a simple being, the y is surprisingly complex.  implication of mitophagy in parkinsons disease provides an example of how studies in the y can reveal molecular and cellular mechanisms of disease.  another example comes from a study reported in 2014 by m. maheshwari, n. r. jana, and colleagues that focused on huntingtons disease.  the study, initiated in mice and continued in flies, implicated down-regulation of a gene called hsfi, which encodes a transcription factor, in huntingtons disease.  making a connection to hsfi led researchers to consider a drug called dexamethasone, already in clinical use as an anti-inammatory, as a possible treatment.17. independent of genetic studies, researchers can ask whether treating the disease model flies with drugs, small molecule inhibitors or agonists, natural products, or chemical derivatives related to traditional medicines can ameliorate symptoms.  with ies, we can do these studies in whole animals, assessing large numbers of individuals, and using assays that span the full natural lifespan of the organism, adding to condence in the outcomes.  18. an example of the use of drosophila models of disease to identify drug treatments comes from studies of fragile x syndrome, which is characterized by altered intellectual ability and a number of behavioural disorders, including sleep irregularities and hyperactivity.  the syndrome is associated with disruption of a specic human gene, fmri.  disruption of the fly ortholog fmri results in changes to neuronal cells that can be quantied and studied, as well as measurable disruptions to fly behaviours, including changes to performance on memory assays and changes in sleep patterns.  in common with mouse models of the disease, fragile x disease model flies also exhibit changes in activity of a specic protein, glur, that can be targeted with drugs.acealevelhttp://acealevel.comwww.dynamicpapers.com","QP_Link":"https://dynamicpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IAL_WBI05_01_OCT19.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI05_01_msc_20200123.pdf"},{"Page":33,"Content":"6p58450a19. the 2005 drosophila study by s. m. mcbride, t. a. jongens, and colleagues also provided the rst evidence that treatment with lithium, which is already approved for clinical treatment of other conditions and affects glur-relevant cellular activities, might have a benecial effect in fragile x syndrome patients.  in 2008, e. berry-kravis, w. t. greenough, and colleagues stated that the results of a small study of human patients were consistent with results in mouse and y models, reporting that the treatment is well-tolerated and provides functional benets.establishing cause20. fly models of disease typically start with an established link between a disease and disruption of a specic gene or genes, or perturbation.  but for some diseases, we are far behind in our knowledge.  21. below are three examples of how drosophila studies helped reshape our thinking regarding mutations known to be causative for a disease, or helped identify the most promising candidatesor the sole causative genefrom a eld of many.  for one of the cases presented, information gained in drosophila studies led to the identication of a new rare inherited disorder, harel-yoon syndrome, the rst to be named (in part) for a drosophila researcher.  although these examples are drawn from the neurological field, the approach is by no means limited to that area.  similar approaches are being applied to other types of diseases.rethink the nature of a genetic cause22. the various forms of charcot-marie-tooth disease comprise a common inherited neuropathy associated with disruption of one of several known genes.  one thing important to our understanding of an inherited disease is to learn whether a given mutation associated with the disease inactivates or reduces function of the gene, or by contrast, increases or changes its function.  given no other evidence, a best guess is that a recessive mutation is likely to be one that inactivates gene function, and a dominant mutation is likely to result in activation or the gain of a function by the gene.  but these assumptions do not always hold true.  charcot-marie-tooth type 2b (cmt2b) is an example of a disease with a dominant pattern of inheritance, with one altered copy of the human gene rab7a (commonly referred to as rab7) sufficient to result in disease.  based on the pattern of inheritance, protein structure analysis, and other studies, cmt2b-associated mutations in rab7a were thought to be gain-of-function mutations, such that a route to therapy might include identication of drugs that reduce rab7a protein activity.  ln 2013, however, s. cherry, r. p. hiesinger, and colleagues reported experimental results obtained in drosophila that suggested a need to rethink the gain-of-function hypothesis for cmt2b-associated mutations in rab7a.  in experimental analyses the researchers obtained data suggesting that cmt2b-associated mutations in rab7/1 are associated with partial loss of function, rather than a gain of function.identify multi-gene-effects23. among the most challenging genetic disorders to approach and understand are those that involve changes in more than one gene. examples include disorders or syndromes associated with chromosome nondisjunction or duplication events that result in the presence of extra copies of an entire chromosomal region in the genome of affected individuals. the best known of these is down syndrome, which results from nondisjunction of chromosome 21, such that affected individuals have three copies of genes on that chromosome instead of two. we commonly associate down syndrome with intellectual disability, but it is associated with additional medical challenges as well. an example is a congenital heart defect present in some but not all down syndrome cases. by 2009, studies in mice, together with detailed human genetic mapping, had limited the chromosomal region implicated in the heart defect to one end of chromosome 21. however, although three likely candidate genes could be identied, there remained uncertainty regarding which specic genes were at fault and the precise relationships among them.acealevelhttp://acealevel.comwww.dynamicpapers.com","QP_Link":"https://dynamicpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IAL_WBI05_01_OCT19.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI05_01_msc_20200123.pdf"},{"Page":34,"Content":"7p58450a24. a 2011 study by t. r. grossman, a. gamliel, and colleagues cleared the fog. they rst tested the effects of overexpressing the mammalian or fly version of any of ve candidate genes in the region. three genes scored as positive in at least two assays related to drosophila heart disease. to better mimic what happens in down syndrome patientswherein more than one gene is present in an extra copythe researchers then created flies in which any combination of two of these three genes is expressed at increased levels. they found that increased expression in the fly heart of two genes, col6a2 and dscam, together resulted in a strong effect on fly heart function. they went on to do a similar test in the mouse heart and made similar ndings. although the animal models do not exhibit all the defects observed in the hearts of down syndrome patients with congenital heart disease, the ndings suggest an avenue worthy of pursuit.solve a mystery25. the nih-funded undiagnosed diseases network (udn) is designed to address the problem that every year hundreds of men, women and children face hardships and uncertainty when their healthcare providers are unable to discover the cause for their symptoms. next-generation sequencing provides an opportunity for medical genetics experts and others to identify candidate genes that underlie individual cases. in some cases, genome sequence data point clinicians in the direction of previously identied diseases. in others, the data suggest that the disease might be one previously uncharacterized or undened at the level of genetic cause. the udn has purposefully turned to drosophila and other model organism studies in order to help identify genetic causes of previously undiagnosed diseases in an efficient and effective manner.adapted from

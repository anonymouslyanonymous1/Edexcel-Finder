what is the star? how does it function, and what is it used for?  these are some of the questions that l set out to answer about this unusual mammal.  it turns out that the star-nosed mole has more than an interesting face; it also has a remarkably specialized brain that may help answer long-standing questions about the organization and evolution of the mammalian nervous system. 2. lt may comfort you to know that star-nosed moles (condylura cristata) are small animals, tipping the scales at a mere 50 grams, about twice the weight of a mouse.  they live in shallow tunnels in wetlands across much of the northeastern u.s. and eastern canada and hunt both underground and underwater.  like the other roughly 30 members of the mole family (talpidae), the star-nosed mole is part of the mammalian order lnsectivora, a group known for its high metabolism and voracious appetite.  so the tiny star-nosed mole with its big appetite must locate enough prey to survive cold northern winters.  it finds earthworms in soil, as other moles do, but in addition it has access to a host of small invertebrates and insect larvae found in the rich mud and leaves of its wetland habitat and in the ponds and streams where it swims along the murky bottom to root out prey.  and seeking prey is where the star comes into play.  the star is not part of the olfactory systemwhich governs smellnor is it an extra hand used to gather food.  instead the star is a touch organ of unsurpassedsensitivity.getting close to the star3. when i began to explore the anatomy of the star with a scanning electron microscopean instrument that reveals the microscopic structure of the skin surfacei thought i would see touch receptors here and there in various places across the skin.  instead i was surprised to find that the star, like the retina in the human eye, is made up entirely of sensory organs.  the surface of each of the 22 appendages that ring the nostrils is composed of an aggregation of microscopic protuberances, or papillae, called eimers organs.  each eimers organ, in turn, is made up of an array of neural structures, each of which signals different aspects of touch.4. three distinct sensory receptors accompany each eimers organ.  at the very bottom of the organ is a single nerve ending that is encircled by many concentric rings, or lamellae, of tissue formed by a schwann cell, a specialized support cell.  this lamellated receptor transmits relatively simple information about vibrations or about when an individual organ first contacts an object.  above this receptor is another nerve fiber that makes contact with a specialized cell called a merkel cell.  unlike the lamellate variety, the merkel cell-neurite complex signals only the sustained depression of the skin.  both these receptors are commonly found in mammalian skin.

(in all mammals, the left half of the body is represented predominantly in the right side of the cortex, and vice versa.) to our amazement, we also found that these maps are visible in sections of the brain that were stained for various cell markerswe could literally see a star pattern in the cortex.13. when we compared the sizes of cortical brain maps with the appendages of the star, we noticed an obvious discrepancy.  the 11th appendage, which is one of the smallest parts of the star, had by far the largest representation in the cortex.  the discrepancy is a classic example of what has been termed cortical magnification: the most important part of the sensory surface has the largest representation in the brain, regardless of the actual size of the sensory area on the animal. 14. the same phenomenon occurs in the visual system, in which the small retinal fovea has by far the largest portion in visual cortex maps.  we also discovered that neurons representing the 11th appendage responded to tactile stimulation of very small areas, or receptive fields, on the 11th appendage, whereas neurons representing the other appendages responded solely to stimulation of larger areas.  the smaller receptive fields for the 11th appendage reflect a greater acuity for this region and mirror the organization of visual systems. 15. the discovery of a somatosensory fovea in the star-nosed mole suggests that this organizational scheme is a general evolutionary solution to constructing a high-resolution sensory system.  visual systems with a fovea are the most familiar, but auditory systems can have an acoustic fovea as well, as has been elegantly demonstrated in mustached bats by nobuo suga of washington university in st. louis.  many bats emit an echo-location call that contains a narrow frequency range and then analyze returning echoes to navigate and to detect prey.  a large proportion of the bats auditory receptors (hair cells in the cochlea) and large areas in the bats brain are devoted to analysing a narrow frequency range corresponding to a single harmonic of the returning echo.  this is an example of an acoustic fovea.16. although it is hard to imagine, bats have an auditory version of a saccade as well.  this is necessary because returning echoes are doppler-shifted to different frequenciesdepending on the speed of the bat and its target, usually an unfortunate insectand often fall outside the frequency range of the acoustic fovea.  because the hunting bat cannot change its acoustic fovea, it constantly changes the frequency of its outgoing pulses so that the doppler-shifted returning echo will be at the frequency of its acoustic fovea.  the behavior is called doppler-shift compensation and is the acoustic equivalent of moving the eyes, or the star, to analyze a stimulus with the high-resolution area of the sensory surface and the corresponding computational areas of the brain.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI05_01_que_20180612.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI05_01_rms_20180815.pdf"},{"Page":32,"Content":"5p51863aturn over    17. the presence of a sensory fovea in the mammalian visual system, auditory system and somatosensory system is a dramatic case of convergent evolution and points to common constraints in the way evolution can construct a complex brain.  after all, why not just wire the entire sensory system for high-resolution input and eliminate the need to constantly shift the eyes, star or echolocation frequency? one reason, of course, is that it would take a massive enlargement of the brainand the nerves carrying sensory inputs to itto accomplish this task. 18. it is staggering to consider just how much larger the human brain would have to be if the entire retina were to have the same resolution as the fovea.  to accomplish this, the human brain would have to be at least 50 times bigger.  your head would no longer fit through a doorway.  clearly, it is more efficient to devote a large part of the computational resources of the brain to a small part of the sensory system and then to move that area around like a spotlight to analyze important aspects of theworld.space race in the brain19. as often occurs, our observations about the star-nosed moles sensory system raised as many questions as they answered.  how does part of a sensory surface acquire such a large section of the brains map in the first place? the traditional understanding has been that each sensory input acquires the same average amount of area in a cortical map during development, and thus the enlarged representation of a sensory fovea simply reflects the greater number of neurons collecting information from the foveal region.  this theoretical framework, suggesting that each input has equal squatters rights in the brain, is appealing in its simplicity.  but a number of studies challenged this democratic assessment of cortical parcellation in the primate visual system by showing that inputs from the fovea are allocated more cortical territory than those containing peripheral information.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI05_01_que_20180612.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI05_01_rms_20180815.pdf"},{"Page":33,"Content":"6p51863a20. to see what was happening in the star-nosed mole, we decided to measure the cortical representations of the 22 appendages and to compare those areas with the number of nerve fibers collecting information from each appendage.  it was obvious (after counting more than 200,000 nerve fibers!) that sensory neurons collecting information from the 11th appendage are granted far more cortical territory in the brain maps than inputs from the other appendages.  this is another parallel between the moles somatosensory system and primate visual systems, and it shows not only that important areas of a sensory surface can have the highest number of sensory neurons collecting information per unit area but also that each of these inputs can be allocated extra computational space in the brain.21. this observation, however, does not explain how these sensory inputs manage to take the most territory in cortical maps.  the question belongs to one of the most fascinating areas of research in neuroscience because changes to cortical maps could be a critical component of learning complex skills and recovering from brain injuries or strokes.  several studies indicate that a combination of intrinsic developmental mechanisms and experience-dependent plasticity affects the shape and maintenance of brain maps.22. these findings are especially intriguing in the case of the star-nosed mole because the pattern of use of the noseas measured by how the mole touches prey with the different appendagesvery closely matches the pattern of magnification for the appendage representations in the cortex.  the correspondence suggests that behaviors may shape the way the cortex is organized.  alternatively, intrinsic developmental mechanisms may match the size of cortical maps to their behavioral significance.  it is the classic question of nature versus nurture.the developing star23. looking at how the star develops in mole embryos can help clarify this matter.  because the star develops before its representation in the cortex, sensory inputs from the star have an opportunity to influence the way that the cortical maps form during potentially critical periods of development.24. star-nosed mole embryos come in about the strangest-looking varieties imaginable.  although most embryos look odd, star-nosed moles appear especially weird because the embryonic hands are giganticall the better to dig with laterand the nose is obviously unique.25. studies of the embryos revealed that appendage 11 was the largest appendage during early development, despite its relatively small size in adults.  it also became clear that eimers organs on the star, and the neural structures within each eimers organ, matured first on the 11th appendage.  it is as if this appendage gets a head start compared with all the other ones, which later overtake it in size and number of eimers organs.  as it turns out, the retinal fovea in the visual system also matures early.26. when we examined the corresponding patterns in the somatosensory cortex, we found that markers for metabolic activity appear first in the representation of the 11th appendage.  this suggests that the early development of the fovea results in greater activity in the developing cortical representation of this area, which could allow these inputs to capture the largest area in the cortical map.  strong evidence from the developing visual system of primates indicates that sensory inputs with the greatest level of activity are able to capture the largest areas in the cortex during development.  but it is also possible that early behavioral patterns in star-nosed moleswhich use the 11th appendage to sucklecontribute to activity-dependent expansion of the fovea in the cortical maps.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI05_01_que_20180612.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Biology/2013/Exam%20materials/WBI05_01_rms_20180815.pdf"},{"Page":34,"Content":"7p51863ahow the mole got its star27. one cant help but wonder how the star-nosed mole evolved. examining the embryos provided a road map to star-nosed mole evolutionor at least to that of its enigmatic nose.  the appendages that form the star develop unlike any other known animal appendage.  rather than growing directly out of the body wall, the star appendages form as cylinders, facing backward and embedded in the side of the moles face.  in the course of development, these slowly emerge from the face, break free from the skin and then, about two weeks after birth, bend forward to form the adult star.  the backward developmental sequence suggests that ancestral star-nosed moles might have had strips of sensory organs lying flat against the sides of the snout.  these might have been slowly raised up over many generations until the star was formed.28. of course, without further evidence, this might remain a just so story.  but there exist two mole speciesthe coast mole (scapanus orarius) and townsends mole (s. townsendii)that have short strips of sensory organs lying flat against the upper side of their noses, and these adult noses bear an uncanny resemblance to the embryonic star.  these intermediate forms strongly suggest that such an ancestor gave rise to the full-fledged star we see today.  however they came to be, these unlikely noses may help reveal much about the influence of innate developmental mechanisms and behavioral patterns on the organization of the cortex. kenneth c. catania first encountered star-nosed moles when he worked at the national zoo in washington, d.c., many years ago.  catania, who is stevenson professor of biological sciences at vanderbilt university, studies the sensory system of mammals and the organization of the neocortex.  he received his undergraduate degree in zoology from the university of maryland and his ph.d. in neuroscience from the university of california, san diego.  catania has received the capranica foundation award in

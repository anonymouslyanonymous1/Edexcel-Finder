larvae that feed on the fruit.the larvae develop into pupae that become adult flies.a student investigated the effect of using an organic pesticide, pyrethrum, on the hatching of eggs and the development of pupae.sixteen flasks containing a culture medium were prepared. eight flasks had 0.5g of pyrethrum added.each flask had one female fly that layed eggs for 24hours. the fly was then

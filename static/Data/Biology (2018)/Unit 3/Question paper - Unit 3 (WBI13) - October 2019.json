derived from plants may be used in food preservation. an investigation was carried out to assess the antimicrobial properties of extracts from five plants: clove, cumin, ginger, pomegranate and thyme. two types of bacteria were used, type a and type b. filter paper discs were placed in each extract for 10 minutes and then allowed to dry. five discs, one for each extract, were placed onto an agar plate spread with bacteria of type a.  this was repeated for bacteria of type b. a control disc was added to each plate. the diagram shows one agar plate after this procedure was completed.

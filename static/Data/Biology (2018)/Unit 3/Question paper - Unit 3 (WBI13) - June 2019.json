reaction:urea    ammonia  +  carbon dioxidethe effect of ph on this reaction was investigated using the following method. one test tube containing 5cm3 of urease solution was placed in a water bath at 40c and left for 10minutes. another test tube containing 5cm3 of urea solution in a buffer at ph3.0 was placed in the same water bath and left for 10minutes. after 10minutes, the contents of both tubes were mixed together in one test tube. this test tube was replaced in the water bath. the concentration of ammonia was measured after 15minutes and again after 60minutes. the procedure was repeated for ph values of 4.0, 6.5, 6.8, 7.3, 8.0and9.0.(a) (i) explain why the urease solution and the urea solution were kept in the waterbath at 40c before and after being

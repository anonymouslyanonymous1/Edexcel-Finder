[some] viruses basically incorporate their own genome into the cells of their hosts, says turlings. the research suggests that the extent to which horizontal gene transfer occurs in nature is probably underestimated, says caitlin byrt at the australian national university in canberra. what this shows is that where theres a really strong pressure for survival on an organism, it can actually borrow genetic information that helps it do that from other organisms, says byrt.7. the researchers demonstrated the function of btpmat1 in whiteflies by selectively interfering with the gene using small molecules of rna. disrupting the genes function made the whiteflies susceptible to compounds known as phenolic glycosides that are present in tomato plants. after feeding on tomato plants that had been genetically modified to produce the rna molecules, all whiteflies subsequently died. 8. this demonstrates a mechanism that we could use in engineering crops to basically target plant pests, and target the resistance of crops to plant pests, says byrt, although she points out that horizontal gene transfer may then allow the pests to evolve resistance to our genetic engineering.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International-Advanced-Level/Biology/2018/Exam-materials/wbi15-01-que-20240608.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International-Advanced-Level/Biology/2018/Exam-materials/wbi15-01-rms-20240815.pdf"},{"Page":42,"Content":"  3turn over     p75775aarticle 29. glofish are fluorescent transgenic zebrafish. these are illegal in many countries.  glofish are zebrafish containing a dsred gene from a sea coral that makes the fish fluorescent under ultraviolet light. zebrafish are normally silver and black. there are several versions of the dsred gene, each resulting in a different coloured phenotype, from fluorescent yellow to fluorescent red.10.as it is illegal to import these transgenic fish into many countries, technology is used to detect them. a pcr-based method has been developed to detect transgenic zebrafish harbouring the gene (dsred) coding for the red fluorescent protein, originally isolated from the marine sponge discosoma striata. 11.two types of pcr have been performed: pcr to detect amplifiable genomic zebrafish dna was checked using primers specific for the zebrafish parvalbumin gene; pcr with primers to specifically amplify the dsred gene. 12.in both pcr systems, genomic dna isolated from wild type zebrafish was used as a control template, in the second pcr system, the plasmid dsred2-n1 was used as a positive control.13.applying this method to several specimens of presumed glofish from traders in the netherlands and germany revealed the presence of transgenic fish. in addition, a rapid method for screening zebrafish suspected to be genetically modified has been developed by measuring the fluorescence of water-soluble protein.article 314.red and yellow and at least 70 other colours. a genetically engineered fish has skin cells in all the colours of the rainbow and then some. its beauty is more than skin deep though  the huge variation in colour could be used to track individual cells as they develop, move and regenerate.15.the skinbow zebrafish was created using a gene that codes for red, blue and green fluorescent proteins, although only one colour is produced at a time. ken poss at duke university in durham, north carolina, and his colleagues injected this gene into single-cell fish embryos. in one particular embryo, this gene became incorporated into part of the genome that patterns skin cells.16.as an adult, this fish looked reddish in colour, but when the team shone a uv light on its skin, it lit up in technicolour. we didnt know these patterns would develop just in the skin, says poss. when you make genetically engineered animals, you cant fully predict the outcome.17.poss thinks that each of the fishs skin cells has about 100 copies of the gene. whether each gene creates a red, green or blue protein is entirely random, he says. one cell might have 80 red, 10 green and 10 blue proteins, for example, says poss. each cell could have one of about 5000 possible colour combinations, although the resolution of posss microscope only lets him distinguish 70 different colours among the cells.

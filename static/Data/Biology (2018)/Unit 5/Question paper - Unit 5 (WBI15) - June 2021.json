article for use with question 8skeletal muscle performance and ageing  tieland  20181. the world population is ageing rapidly. since 1980, the number of people aged 60 years and over has doubled to approximately 810 million. the elderly population will continue to grow to approximately 2 billion in 2050. as society ages, the incidence of physical performance limitation will increase as well. in western society, as much as 42% of those over 60 years of age have difficulties in performing activities of daily living (e.g. walking speed or standing up from a chair), and >30% are confronted with physical disabilities. these physical limitations increase the risk of falls, institutionalization, comorbidity, and premature death.2. while there are a number of contributors to physical limitations with advancing age, one of the more prominent contributors is undoubtedly a reduction in skeletal muscle performance. one of the hallmark changes of ageing that is linked to reductions in muscle performance is the loss of skeletal muscle mass, which is commonly referred to as sarcopenia. the body consists of more than 500 skeletal muscles which are controlled by the nervous system and which connects and supports the skeletal system. skeletal muscles consist of muscle fibres, each containing sarcomeres, which are the smallest repeating functional units in the muscle. via a series of complex events, sarcomeres are responsible for muscle contraction and relaxation. this allows the body to perform a wide variety of different movements, ranging from fast and powerful movements to small and fine motions. since skeletal muscles are responsible for all the voluntary movements, logically, skeletal muscles are essential for optimal physical performance. physiological changes, such as a loss of motor units, changes in fibre type, muscle fibreatrophy, and reduced neuromuscular activation, could affect the velocity, force, and strength of movements, leading to reduced physical performance, potentially leading to functional disability and institutionalization. 3. not only are skeletal muscles important for physical performance, they are also an important contributing factor in maintaining optimal health throughout life. as such, skeletal muscles are involved in different metabolic pathways. since muscles are the primary site for the insulinstimulated glucose uptake from the blood, the muscles are crucial in maintaining glucose homeostasis.  muscles are also involved in other metabolic functions providing a site for fatty acid metabolism and glycogen synthesis. metabolic disturbances in muscle could, therefore, lead to insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, and obesity.  furthermore, muscles interact with other organs via the excretion of myokines, which can exert autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine effects. myokines support the metabolic function of different tissues, such as the bones, pancreas, liver, and adipose tissue.  the metabolic function of skeletal muscle and the role of myokines both illustrate the importance of the muscles in maintaining optimal health throughout life.4.  at the myocellular level, many studies have reported a substantial decrease in muscle fibre size in the elderly. this reduction in muscle fibre size has been shown to be fibre type specific, with 1040% smaller type ii fibres observed in the elderly as compared with young adults. in contrast, type i muscle fibre size seems to be largely sustained with ageing. the type i, or slow twitch fibres, are recruited first and, as such, are mainly responsible for endurancetype activities. the type ii, or fast twitch fibres, are recruited later and predominantly responsible for higher intensity or highly fatiguing activities. the reduction in type ii fibres may therefore result in a decline in muscle strength in the elderly and may decrease the ability to rise from a chair or to lift a heavy load.

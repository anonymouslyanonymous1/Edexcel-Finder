gives the procedure in outline.step 1 a nitrating mixture is prepared by mixing 12.5 cm3 of concentrated sulfuric acid with 10.6 cm3 of concentrated nitric acid.  both acids are precooled and  the mixing is carried out very slowly.step 2 9.20 g of methylbenzene is placed in a round bottom flask and the nitrating mixture is added very slowly while cooling the mixture.  when mixing is complete, the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and then stirred for two hours.step 3 the reaction mixture is poured into water.  the organic layer is separated and sodium hydrogencarbonate solution is added.step 4 the organic layer is separated again, and a drying agent is added before the mixture is distilled.some of the physical properties of 1methyl2nitrobenzene and the other

pear-shaped flask fitted with a reflux condenser step 2  add 7.0 cm3 of ethanoyl chloride (an excess) by pouring it carefully down the reflux condenser step 3  heat the contents of the pear-shaped flask slowly to boiling, and heat under reflux for 15 minutes step 4  allow the mixture to cool and then add 5.0 cm3 of water step 5  heat the solution slowly to boil it for a few minutes step 6  allow the solution to cool slowly to room temperature step 7  collect the crystals of 2-ethanoylaminobenzoic acid using suction filtration step 8  recrystallise the 2-ethanoylaminobenzoic acid step 9

when dilute aqueous solutions of potassium manganate(vii), ethanedioic acid and sulfuric acid are mixed, the following reaction occurs:2mno4  +  5c2o42  +  16h+    2mn2+  +  10co2  +  8h2othe rate of reaction is slow at first, accelerates rapidly and then gradually slows down.  the best explanation for these observations is that thea reaction is exothermic, so after a small amount of reaction the temperature rises sharply.b reaction is acid catalysed and the formation of carbon dioxide results in an increased concentration of hydrogen ions.c reaction is catalysed by the manganese(ii) ions which are formed in the reaction.d high concentration of hydrogen ions from the sulfuric acid inhibits the dissociation of the ethanedioic acid.(total for question 2 = 1 mark)use this space for any

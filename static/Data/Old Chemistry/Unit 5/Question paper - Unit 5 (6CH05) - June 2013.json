Write your answers in the spaces provided.  Titanium is the seventh most abundant metal in the Earth s crust and occurs principally as rutile (impure titanium(IV) oxide, TiO.).  Early attempts to extract the metal from its oxide by reduction with heated carbon failed because the compound titanium carbide is formed. In 1910, however, pure titanium was made by heating titanium(IV) chloride with sodium.  Titanium has a high melting temperature and a density of 4.50 g cm >. Titanium is as strong as steel, but is about 40% less dense and is therefore suitable for use in the aircraft industry. Titanium metal resists corrosion as it has an impervious coating of titanium(IV) oxide. The metal adheres well to bone, is not rejected by the body and is in demand for the manufacture of replacement joints.  Titanium has two common oxidation states, +3 and +4. Solutions containing the [Ti(H,O),] *(aq) ion, such as titaniumilll) chloride, are purple in colour  and are readily oxidized by the oxygen in air to colourless titanium(IV) ions. An aqueous solution of titanium(III) chloride is a strong reducing agent. Titanium(IV) chloride, TiCL,, is a colourless liquid with a boiling temperature of 136  C. This compound is used, in conjunction with organic compounds of aluminium, as a catalyst for the polymerization of propene to poly(propene). Titanium(IV) chloride is hydrolysed by water to give titanium(IV) oxide, TiO, and hydrogen chloride gas.  Titanium(IV) oxide is a white, non-toxic solid at room temperature. It is used as a white pigment in paint, largely replacing toxic lead compounds which were used previously. Titanium(IV) oxide reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid to form a salt and water. Titanium(IV) oxide also reacts with aqueous potassium hydroxide solution, under suitable conditions, to form a compound with formula K,Ti(OH)..  (a) (i) Write the equation for the reaction which occurs during the manufacture of titanium from titanium(IV) chloride as described in the article above. State symbols are not required.

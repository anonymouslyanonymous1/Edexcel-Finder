everyday applications of chemistry.the simplest organic nitrogen compounds are amines, which may be regarded as derivatives of ammonia in which one or more of the hydrogen atoms of ammonia have been replaced by an alkyl group or an aryl group.  some simple amines are shown below.h3cnh2nhh3ch3cch3nh3ch3cnh2 methylamine dimethylamine trimethylamine phenylamine (aniline)amines with one alkyl group are called primary, with two alkyl groups secondary and with three alkyl groups tertiary.  because of the presence of nitrogen, the physical and chemical properties of alkyl amines are similar to those of ammonia but the similarities are less marked with phenylamine.amides are carboxylic acid derivatives which have a carbonyl group adjacent to anamine group.  the simplest amide is ethanamide:h3cconh2ethanamidebecause the two groups are adjacent, the chemical properties of amides are different from those of amines.amino acids are compounds with an amine group and a carboxylic acid group.  the presence of these two functional groups gives amino acids properties that are also different from those of amines.  the great significance of the amino acids is their ability to form polymers called polypeptides, leading to the formation of proteins, the building blocks of life.  to form polypeptides, amino acids are joined by the amide group, sometimes called the peptide link.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Chemistry/2013/Exam%20materials/WCH05_01_que_20150120.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Chemistry/2013/Exam%20materials/WCH05_01_msc_20150305.pdf"},{"Page":23,"Content":"24*p45045a02428*

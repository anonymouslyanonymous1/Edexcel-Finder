synthesisnaturally occurring ketones are often found in foods.  butane-2,3-dione gives a buttery flavour, and heptan-2-one is found in some blue cheeses.  the molecules giving flavour may contain other groups as well as the carbonyl group.  spearmint oil contains c=c bonds and raspberryketone contains a phenolic group.camphor is a naturally occurring ketone which reduces itching and is a moth repellent.  ketones are important in chemical synthesis because they undergo nucleophilic addition reactions.  ketones also react with other carbonyl compounds in condensation reactions.  they are used in synthesis to extend the carbon chain in a molecule, for example by reacting with hydrogencyanide.aldol condensations are reactions between two carbonyl compounds, such as two ketone molecules, or an aldehyde and a ketone. one example is the reaction of propanone with ethanal.ooooho++ h2oohh+ propanone ethanalaromatic ketones can be made by reacting benzene with acyl chlorides in the friedel-crafts reaction.  this produces ketones such as ethyl phenyl ketone which contain the c6h5co group.2-hydroxycarboxylicacids can be prepared from ketones, and these compounds are intermediates from which many other products can be made.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Chemistry/2013/Exam%20materials/ial-wch05-01-nov19.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Chemistry/2013/Exam%20materials/WCH05_01_msc_20200123.pdf"},{"Page":22,"Content":"23*p58300a02328*turn

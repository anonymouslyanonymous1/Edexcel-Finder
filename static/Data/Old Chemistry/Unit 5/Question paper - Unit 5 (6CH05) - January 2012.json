sight of tubes of paint or of coloured pencils in an artists supply shop is something that most people enjoy; we love colour. the ability to synthesise brightly-coloured compounds coincides with the rapid growth of the organic chemicals industry.  synthetic organic dyes started to appear in the mid-19th century when william perkin synthesised mauve in 1856 at the age of 18.  he was trying to synthesise quinine even though he did not know the structure of the molecule. in the 19th century many chemists did not believe that molecules existed.  the work of butlerov, couper, and notably kekul showed that molecules not only exist but have specific structures.  in 1865 kekul suggested a ring structure for the aromatic compound benzene which he represented as kekul knew that benzene does not react with bromine water.  later work showed that the enthalpy change of hydrogenation of the compound is 205 kj mol1,  rather than the value of  360 kj mol1 that would be expected if the structure was exactly as shown above, given that the enthalpy change of hydrogenation for cyclohexene to cyclohexane is 120 kj mol1. when greiss in 1856 discovered diazotisation and the azo dyes, he used a reaction characteristic of aromatic amines.  witt, in 1876, found the functional groups in the dye molecule that make it water-soluble and enable it to attach to the cloth fibres.  graebe, liebermann and perkin in 1869 patented the synthesis of alizarin, found in madder root grown in holland and von baeyer synthesised indigo in 1880, until then grown in india.  synthetic dyes were made available in large quantities and were cheaper than the sources from plants. now the organic chemical industry produces a vast range of pigments and dyestuffs for use in paints and for fabrics, inks and other materials, making our world the most colourful that it has ever been.+ h2

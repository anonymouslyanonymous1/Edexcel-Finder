(z = 29) is due to its limited chemical reactivity and high thermal and electrical conductivity.  copper compounds have significant biological activity.  like silver and gold, copper can occur in nature as the pure element, although it is mostly obtained from one of the minerals that contain copper compounds.the physical properties of copper have resulted in its widespread use in electrical wiring and in plumbing.  due to its cost and relative softness, the use of pure copper in coinage has largely been superseded by alloys, some of which contain no copper at all.copper is placed in the d-block of the periodic table and forms compounds with two stable oxidation states: copper(i), which resembles silver(i), and copper(ii).  the characteristics of copper(ii) lead to the classification of copper as a transition element.  both copper(i) and copper(ii) form a range of complex ions; copper(i) complexes are colourless but copper(ii) complexes are coloured, often blue.(a) (i) complete

ion.(1)","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Chemistry/2013/Exam%20materials/WCH05_01_que_20180613.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Chemistry/2013/Exam%20materials/WCH05_01_rms_20180815.pdf"},{"Page":24,"Content":"25*p51938a02528*do

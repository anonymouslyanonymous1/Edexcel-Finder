dative covalent bonds is the coordination number of the cation in the complex.  complexes may be positive, negative or neutral.  the ligands may be neutral or negatively charged, but are never positively charged.  the ligands must have a lone pair of electrons.  in some complexes the central atom is neutral, as is the case with nickel carbonyl which is used in the mond process for the purification of nickel:ni(s)  +  4co(g)  u\u0001\u0001ni(co)4(g)the formation of complexes is typical of transition metals but other elements also form complexes.  zinc, which is a d block element but not a transition metal, and aluminium, which is a group 3 element, both form complexes.  transition metal complexes are usually coloured, but if the interaction between the ligand and the central ion is very strong, then the resulting complex may well be colourless.  this is the case with the complex [fef6]3−.the ligand in a complex affects its redox properties and this is apparent from considering the relevant standard electrode potentials.  for example, with copper(ii) species:[cu(h2o)6]2+(aq)  +  2e−  u  cu(s)  +  6h2o(l)      e 9 = +0.34 v[cu(h2o)2(nh3)4]2+(aq)  +  2e−  u  cu(s)

hydrochloric acid and, after neutralization, excess dimethylglyoxime dissolved in ethanol is added to the solution formed.  the resulting red precipitate is filtered, washed, dried and weighed.  the equation for the formation of the precipitate is  (i) state the coordination number of the nickel in the complex ion.(1)  (ii) in an experiment, 1.02 g of nisil formed 4.82 g of the complex.  calculate the percentage by mass of nickel in the alloy.  the molar mass of the complex is 288.7 g mol−1.(2)nh3cch3nohni2+  +  2hoh3cni2+h3cccnno–ohch3ch3ccnnhoo–+

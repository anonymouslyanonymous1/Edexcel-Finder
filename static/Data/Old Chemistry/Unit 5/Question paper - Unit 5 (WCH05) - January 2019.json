c6h5nh2, does not occur naturally, but can be prepared from benzene.  however, it cannot be prepared in the same way as aliphatic amines.  these can be prepared by simply reacting a bromoalkane with ammonia or an amine.many different aromatic compounds are synthesised using phenylamine as a starting material.  in 1850 the chemist hofmann made n,n-dimethylphenylamine, c6h5n(ch3)2.  using this compound and another compound derived from 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid, the indicator methyl orange can be made. other indicators such as methyl yellow and methyl red are also prepared using phenylamine.sulfonamide drugs are also synthesised from phenylamine.  they were the first antibacterial agents, but some of this class of drugs, such as carbutamide, act as antidiabetes drugs.sh2nn hn hooocarbutamidephenylamine is also the starting point for the production of many anaesthetics.   most local anaesthetics contain an ester or amide link, and a tertiary amine group, in which a nitrogen

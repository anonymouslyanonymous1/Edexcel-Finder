however, uncertainty about the nature and purity of the plant extracts being used and in standardising their application prompted fallopius, a leading sixteenth century physician, to complain when soporifics are weak, they are useless, and when strong, they kill.  modern analytical techniques have all but eliminated these problems.anaesthetics are divided into two broad categories: general anaesthetics, which cause a reversible loss of consciousness, and local anaesthetics, which result in the absence of pain sensation in the area where they are applied.  general anaesthetics may be delivered by inhalation or injection, while local anaesthetics may be injected or applied directly to the surface.  the structures of some anaesthetics are shown below.ethoxyethane was first synthesized in 1540 by distilling a mixture of ethanol and concentrated sulfuric acid.  although its anaesthetic properties were established at this time, it was not until the nineteenth century that it was used as an inhalational general anaesthetic in medical procedures.  however, ethoxyethane is highly flammable and has unpleasant side effects, so it has been entirely replaced by compounds like desflurane in modern medical practice.  propofol is a general anaesthetic which is administered by injection.procaine and benzocaine are local anaesthetics and are examples of aminoester

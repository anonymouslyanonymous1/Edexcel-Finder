number of different types of isomerism. hydration isomerism is where different numbers of water molecules act as ligands. the name chromium(iii) chloride is given to several chemical compounds with the formula crcl3xh2o, including a number of hydration isomers.(a) anhydrous chromium(iii) chloride, crcl3, is a violet solid which can react with water to produce three isomers. [cr(h2o)6]3+3cl is violet. [cr(h2o)5cl]2+2clh2o is pale green.

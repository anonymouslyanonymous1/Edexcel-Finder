in the periodic table comprising the elements from lanthanum, la (z = 57) to lutetium, lu (z = 71). they have important uses as elements and compounds, for example, in the screens, circuits and speakers of smartphones. these elements have some similar properties to d-block elements.many of the lanthanide elements are obtained by heating their trichlorides or trifluorides with calcium at 1000oc.these elements form part of the f-block of the periodic table as the last electron added enters an f-orbital. there are seven f-orbitals in the f-subshell.the electronic configurations of the atoms consist of the electronic configuration of xenon followed by electrons in the 4f and 6s orbitals and sometimes the 5d orbitals. for example:\tsamarium, sm\t[xe]4f66s2\teuropium, eu\t[xe]4f76s2\tgadolinium, gd\t[xe]4f75d16s2\tterbium, tb\t[xe]4f96s2all of the lanthanides form ions with a charge of 3+ and the ionic radii of these ions decrease as the atomic number of the element increases.the lanthanides form complex ions, for example, [ce(h2o)9]3+ and [yb(h2o)8]3+. many of the complex ions formed from the elements in the lanthanide series are coloured and this colour is caused by f–f transitions.cerium(iv) ammonium nitrate is yellow in aqueous solution and gives a red colour with  all alcohols.  cerium(iv) ammonium sulfate is used in redox titrations with ferroin as the indicator.  the colour change is red to yellow.use your knowledge of d-block elements to help you to answer the questions.","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Chemistry/2018/Exam-materials/WCH15_01_que_20201023.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Chemistry/2018/Exam-materials/WCH15_01_msc_20210113.pdf"},{"Page":26,"Content":"*p64621a02732*turn

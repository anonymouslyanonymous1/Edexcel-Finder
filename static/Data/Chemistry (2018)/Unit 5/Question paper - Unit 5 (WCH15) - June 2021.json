haemoglobin which is responsible for oxygen transport in the blood of most vertebrates. the haemoglobin-iron complex with oxygen is responsible for the red colour of blood.iron(iii) ions may be detected in solution by the addition of thioglycolic acid (hsch2cooh). all the water ligands of the iron(iii) ion are replaced giving  a complex with an intense red colour which can be detected in  very low concentrations.the complexes of iron(ii) and iron(iii) usually have a coordination number of  six and are octahedral but the chloro complexes have a coordination number of four and are tetrahedral.iron and its compounds can act as catalysts. the element catalyses the haber process, acting as a typical heterogeneous catalyst. however, the compounds and complexes of iron are usually

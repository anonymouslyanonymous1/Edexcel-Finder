(a)  the time between a bat emitting a pulse towards a building and the echo being  detected is 0.045 s.     calculate the distance from the bat to the building.     speed of sound in air = 340 m s 1 (3)       distance =    (b) when a bat is closer to its prey the following changes take place:        the ultrasound emitted by the bat becomes higher in frequency;        the pulses become shorter in duration;        the pulses are separated by a shorter time interval.     explain why these changes are made.

[{"Title":"January 2013","Page":15,"Content":"16 *p41628a01628* 17 when tidying a prep room, a teacher discovers a tray of resistance wires that have lost  their labels.  she decides to ask her students to carry out experiments to determine the  material that each wire is made of by measuring the resistivity of the wires.   (a) explain why the teacher asks the students to measure the resistivity and not the  resistance of the wires. (2)      *(b) you are to describe a method to determine accurately the resistivity of one of the  metal wires.     your description should include:     $              !       %       !        $      &          %       !            $            %       !          $      %       ! !                       %  (9) pmt ","Image_Link":"./static/SixMark/Old Physics/Unit 2/January 2013 pg15.png","QP_Link":"https://pmt.physicsandmathstutor.com/download/Physics/A-level/Past-Papers/Edexcel-IAL/Unit-2/January 2013 QP - Unit 2 Edexcel Physics A-level.pdf","MS_Link":"https://pmt.physicsandmathstutor.com/download/Physics/A-level/Past-Papers/Edexcel-IAL/Unit-2/January 2013 MS - Unit 2 Edexcel Physics A-level.pdf"}]

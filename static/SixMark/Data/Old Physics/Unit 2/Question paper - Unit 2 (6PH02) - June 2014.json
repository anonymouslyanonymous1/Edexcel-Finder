[{"Title":"June 2014","Page":15,"Content":"16*p43119a01624*19 meteorologists use radar to monitor rain. radar uses pulses of microwaves.  the emitted pulses are directed horizontally towards rain.  the pulses are reflected from the rain and detected.  the time taken for the reflected pulses to return, their intensity and frequency are all measured. *(a) explain how these measurements can be used to determine the distance to the rain, the relative speed of the rain towards the detector and the amount of rain falling.(6)","Image_Link":"./static/SixMark/Old Physics/Unit 2/6PH02 June 2014 pg15.png","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Physics/2013/Exam%20materials/Question-paper-Unit-2-(6PH02)-June-2014.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Physics/2013/Exam%20materials/Mark-scheme-Unit-2-(6PH02)-June-2014.pdf","Unit_Code":"6PH02"}]

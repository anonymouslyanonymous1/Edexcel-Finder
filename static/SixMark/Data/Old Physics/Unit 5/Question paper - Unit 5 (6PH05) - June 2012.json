[{"Title":"June 2012","Page":15,"Content":"16*p39856a01628*18 in a demonstration to her class, a teacher pours popcorn kernels onto a hot surface and waits for them to pop.  the kernels pop one by one.  there is a large rate of popping at first and this rate decreases as time goes on.  however, the order in which the kernels pop cannot be predicted.   *(a) how realistic is this demonstration as an analogy to radioactive decay?  consider aspects of the demonstration that are similar to radioactive decay and aspects that are different.(4) (b) in another demonstration, bags of popcorn are placed in a microwave oven for different lengths of time.  initially, each bag contains the same number of kernels.  once the bags are removed from the oven they are opened and the number of unpopped kernels counted.  assume that the popcorn obeys a similar rule to radioactive decay.  the results from the demonstration are shown in the table:time in oven / snumber of unpopped kernels, nln (n)01004.6130784.3660614.1190473.85120373.61150293.37 @##-/80 s.(6)","Image_Link":"./static/SixMark/Old Physics/Unit 5/June 2012 pg15.png","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Physics/2013/Exam%20materials/6PH05_01_que_20120618.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Physics/2013/Exam%20materials/6PH05_01_rms_20120816.pdf"}]

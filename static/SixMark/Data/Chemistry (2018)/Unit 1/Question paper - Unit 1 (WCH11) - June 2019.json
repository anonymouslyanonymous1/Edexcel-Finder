(a) write an equation for the decomposition of sodium azide.   state symbols are not required.(1) (b) a passenger airbag requires 120 dm3 of gas to fill it.  calculate, using the ideal gas equation, the mass of sodium azide required to fill apassenger airbag in this reaction under standard conditions (101 000 pa, 25c).  give your answer to an appropriate number of significant figures.[ pv = nrt      r = 8.31 j k1 mol1 ](6)","Image_Link":"./static/SixMark/Chemistry (2018)/Unit 1/WCH11 June 2019 pg23.png","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Chemistry/2018/Exam-materials/WCH11_01_que_20190521.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Chemistry/2018/Exam-materials/WCH11_01_rms_20190815.pdf","Unit_Code":"WCH11"}]

(a) write an equation for the decomposition of sodium azide.   state symbols are not required.(1) (b) a passenger airbag requires 120 dm3 of gas to fill it.  calculate, using the ideal gas equation, the mass of sodium azide required to fill a passenger airbag in this reaction under standard conditions (101 000 pa, 25°c).  give your answer to an appropriate number of significant figures.[ pv = nrt      r = 8.31 j k−1 mol−1 ](6)","Image_Link":"static/SixMark/Chemistry (2018)/Unit 1/June 2019 pg24.png","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Chemistry/2018/Exam-materials/WCH11_01_que_20190521.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Chemistry/2018/Exam-materials/WCH11_01_rms_20190815.pdf"}]

(a) write the balanced equation for the oxidation of propan-1-ol to form propanoic acid. use [o] to represent the oxygen from the oxidising agent. state symbols are not required.(1)  *(b) propan-1-ol is heated with a concentrated solution of acidified  potassium dichromate(vi).  explain how the conditions used affect the rate of the reaction and ensure that propanoic acid is the only organic product.(6)","Image_Link":"./static/SixMark/Chemistry (2018)/Unit 2/WCH12 June 2019 pg21.png","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Chemistry/2018/Exam-materials/WCH12_01_que_20190524.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/International%20Advanced%20Level/Chemistry/2018/Exam-materials/WCH13_01_pef_20190815.pdf","Unit_Code":"WCH12"}]

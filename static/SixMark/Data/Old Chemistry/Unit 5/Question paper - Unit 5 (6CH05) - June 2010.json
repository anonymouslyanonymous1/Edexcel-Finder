(i) write the ionic equation for the reaction between thiosulfate ions and iodine. (1)  *(ii) the equation for the reaction between copper(ii) ions and iodide ions is shown below.2cu2+ + 4i– → 2cui + i2    hence calculate the percentage by mass of copper in admiralty brass.  give your answer to three significant figures.(6)","Image_Link":"static/SixMark/Old Chemistry/Unit 5/June 2010 pg12.png","QP_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Chemistry/2013/Exam%20materials/6CH05_01_que_20100628.pdf","MS_Link":"https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/A%20Level/Chemistry/2013/Exam%20materials/6CH05_01_msc_20100707.pdf"}]

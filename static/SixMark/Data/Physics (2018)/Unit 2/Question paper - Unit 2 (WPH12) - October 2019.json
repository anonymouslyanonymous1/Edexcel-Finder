[{"Title":"October 2019","Page":11,"Content":"12*p62787a01232* 14 the circuit shown includes a fixed resistor and a negative temperature coefficient thermistor. xyz a potential divider circuit can be created by making connections to a secondary circuit across the resistor (xy) or across the thermistor (yz).  as the temperature changes, the potential differences (p.d.) across xy and yz both change.  such a circuit can be used to operate an air conditioning unit in a hot classroom in order to keep the classroom cool.  the air conditioning unit starts operating when the p.d. in the secondary circuit exceeds a certain value.   *(a) explain how the circuit should be set up to keep the classroom cool.  your answer should include details of how a negative temperature coefficient thermistor works, in terms of particles.
